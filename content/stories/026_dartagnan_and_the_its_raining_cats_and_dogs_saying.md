In March we had a lot of heavy rain, so I had a lot of time to lounge on the sofa and think about life, the universe and everything.

I pondered why people say, “It’s raining cats and dogs,” when there is a heavy downpour.
So, I got onto mum’s computer and Googled for an explanation.

Question

What is the origin of the phrase "it's raining cats and dogs?"

Answer

We don’t know.

Bah, I thought Google knew everything!

Anyway, I kept browsing and discovered a few theories, but will share only 2 here:
- In 1738, Jonathan Swift published his “Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation,” a satire on the conversations of the upper classes. One of his characters fears that it will “rain cats and dogs.” Whether Swift coined the phrase or was using a cliché, his satire was likely the beginning of the phrase’s popularity.
- Odin, the Norse god of storms, was often pictured with dogs and wolves, which were symbols of wind. Witches, who supposedly rode their brooms during storms, were often pictured with black cats, which became signs of heavy rain for sailors. Therefore, “raining cats and dogs” may refer to a storm with wind (dogs) and heavy rain (cats).

My mum who is of French origin has a cruder saying, “il pleut comme vache qui pisse” ("it is raining like a peeing cow)

Anyway, mum said , “Get off the computer Booboo and let’s go for a walk”.

Mum put on her raincoat and then she fiddled about fitting me with my raincoat. What an affair! This flap ties to this Velcro patch, and that flap ties to that Velcro patch and that flap goes under here, and that flap goes across there. “NO, mum, that doesn’t look right”. . Then mum fitted me with my soft harness over the raincoat. Here we go, “this strap goes around the neck, this one under the belly, this one…oh no. Anyway, 15 minutes later I was ready for our sortie.

Mum opened the door and took my leash and said, “let’s go”. I peered out and saw the downpour. So, I dashed forward to do my pipi right there on the front grass and rushed back inside, mum in tow.
“I’m not walking out in this rain,” I said.

So, mum undid my soft harness, the whole affair in reverse.

And I flopped back on the sofa.

Mum made some hot soup and we had dinner and I was still clueless as to why people say it’s raining cats and dogs, because all the smart dogs like me sure were not out in this rain!
