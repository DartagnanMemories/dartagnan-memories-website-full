I like to walk with mum to Summer Hill, and to sit at that little place with the fountain and share some lunch.

I have some favourite shops there: the butcher, IGA, the fast food shops, the fruit shop and most of all, the cake shop!

Mum says ‘find this shop”, ‘find that shop’, and I take her there, tail wagging.

I don’t mind the chemist because they make a fuss about me.  I tolerate Vinnies because mum likes going there.

one recent Friday afternoon we were in Summer Hill and mum asked me to find the bank

“The bank?” I asked.  

Now, I’m no dummy. I  have around 600 words in my vocabulary! 

So I know what’s a bank,  and I know where that bank is  on Lackey St.

But banks bore me.

So anyway we are in the queue at the bank and it’s taking so long and I thought  , ‘what can I do to get some attention here?’

So I flopped on my back, in full harness, and stuck my paws up in the air, belly rub position.   

Customers waiting behind us could not move. Everyone was laughing. It was total chaos. 

Then the bank got the message, and put on an extra teller just for us. Satisfied, I got back on my paws, and made a straight line for the teller, in perfect guide dog mode. That teller gave us extra good service .
