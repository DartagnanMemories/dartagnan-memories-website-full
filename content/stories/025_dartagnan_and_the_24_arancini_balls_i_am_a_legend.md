There are different ways to look at any story. There are the facts; the half-truths; the fabrications; the embellishments; and so on.

Take for example the rumour that I stole and ate 24 arancini rice balls.

That rumour has been going around the village and I just hang my head each time mum tells it.

Ah but at least I have the Grapevine to tell my side of this story!

So it was a beautiful Sunday and my mum and I had been invited to a party at Newtown. Each guest had to bring a dish to share: mum brought 24 arancini rice balls, chicken and mushroom filled. They smelled so nice! But the party host had said ‘home made’ cooking only. Well mum cheated: she got them from the freezer at Woollies and just baked them in the oven that morning.

So to save mum the embarrassment, I got into the bag which had the foil tray with the rice balls, and scoffed them down while mum was on her phone at the park waiting for her friend to park the car and then walk over to the party house.

And when mum told the party guests what I had done, a ha they all thought it was a fake excuse! But the best was when mum tried to tell the vet what I had done, thinking the vet would tell me off.

But he said: “D’artagnan , you are a legend!”
