D’artagnan the guide dog here. 			

It was a pretty usual Friday…Until Pam next door disappeared.

Mum had phoned Pam around lunchtime. But unusually Pam didn’t pick up the phone. Then Janet our block rep dropped-in in the afternoon with mum’s mail and Pam’s mail. But Pam was still not answering the phone or the door. By 4 pm mum started to get worried but by that time the office was closed.
And so mum phoned Sister Liz Harper upstairs in our block.

Mum’s got Pam’s keys. So, the intrepid trio of Chief Inspector Liz Harper (from upstairs); blind Detective Sargent Gisele (mum) and canine squad Constable D’artagnan (me) decided to investigate.
It could have been an episode of the keystone Cops!

Chief Inspector Liz was in front leading mum, and mum was feeling her way around Pam’s place.
Then mum stopped by Aunty Pam’s bed.

“Liz”, mum said in a trembling voice. “I can feel something stiff on the bed…”.

“No” said Inspector Liz, “Don’t let your imagination go there DS Gisele”.

Indeed, the something stiff on the bed was Aunty Pam’s socks-puller-upper thingy.

They checked the bathroom and then the kitchen. No Pam anywhere.

I saw an uneaten Scotch finger biscuit but mum , I mean, DS Gisele, tug at my leash just as I was about to snap that biscuit.

Then we all walked out and Chief Inspector Liz and DS Gisele Gave me the command “Find Pam”
So, I put my nose to the trail and led them round the bend of the walkway and down the garden path.
I sniffed here and sniffed there.

“What are you doing Constable D’artagnan? Find pam.”

I replied, “I have watched Inspector Rex on TV and that’s what he does when he’s on the trail of a scent: I can smell bones meal in the garden bed.”

“constable D’artagnan, leave that alone. Where is Pam?”

“Excuse me. I’m not a psychic”, I riposted. “And by the way it’s 5 pm and that’s my dinner time”.

So, we went back to our place and mum called the INS and explained the situation.

I heard the INS lady say to mum, “I’m sorry but I can’t tell you anything because you are not on the list”

I knew how mum was going to react to that: I put my paws on top of my head to close my ears.
“What list?”, demanded mum in that “what do you mean?” tone.

The INS lady said, “I know where Pam is, but I cannot tell you”.

I thought, “Geez, the INS must have kidnapped Pam. they are going to ask for a ransom. This is bad: When am I going to get my dinner now?”

Anyway, Inspector Liz followed up another line of investigation and solved the case. Pam was in Canterbury Hospital for observation after she had a bad turn the night before.

Aunty Pam is back home now, and all is right with the world.
