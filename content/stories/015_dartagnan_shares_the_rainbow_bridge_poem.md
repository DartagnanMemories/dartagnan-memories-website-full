D’artagnan the guide dog here. Walking around the block with mum one morning, we heard village resident Rae calling out to us.  Rae told us her little dog Andi had passed away. Mum was teary at hearing this news, and my eyes were misty too.  
I thought of the many times we had come across Rae and little Andi on our daily walks. At first Andi had been very scared of me.  Rae had explained this was because     Andi had a bad experience in her past.  So, I was gentle with her  and she got used to me.
Rae told us of a poem called “The Rainbow Bridge” about a beautiful place where departed pets go in the afterlife. 
For my column this month I ask residents of the village to share a few words about their departed dog and I share this poem with all. 
Rae -  “my little Andi was my best buddy and such a good companion for me”
Susan and Graeme – “We would love to tell you about dear Rosie. She passed away nearly  5 years ago at the age of 12. This meant she was only a pooch resident in the village for just over 6 months. She settled in well.
Though her Mother was a Beagle (which we were expecting) the only characteristic that she got from her Mother was a very keen sense of smell as her father was a wiry-hair mut which she came out as.  She preferred humans  to dogs  and on her walks she had to be closely constrained if another dog was coming close to her. Jenny’s Charlie  was on the receiving end when they first met! She was  very much her own person with a regular routine with favourite places and furniture to lie on around the place. She gave us great pleasure and many happy memories of her have still remained with us  to this day.”


Jenny  - “Charlie was a Maltese cross, he was a stray and about 1 year old when I found him.  While living on the Central Coast I was a member of a local drama group and on the executive committee for a number of years.  Charlie attended the meetings and rehearsals and was given honorary membership, he had his own seat at the committee table.  He was a very sociable little dog and was popular around the village.  He became a favourite of the village staff and previous village manager Mark, whenever he saw Mark he would be looking for a pat. He was also an influencing factor Mark buying a dog for his family.   Charlie was nearly 15 when he passed away.”
Mignon – “I had Ollie for 9 weeks at the beginning of the year. He was my cousin’s dog but Liz had to go into care, so I took 13-year-old Ollie. He was a beautiful Cocker Spaniel.
One morning he was very sick and the outcome was he had to be put down. Very sad but we had lots of fun and good walks for 9 weeks so I am grateful for the time we had.”
Anne – Ellie was Half shih tzu part Maltese terrier. She was 14 and a half when she passed away three years ago. On her memorial plaque it reads ‘Ellie baba girl we will miss you’”.


Leo and Sue – “Our Poppy was such a wise little dog.
She knew how to enjoy this world, and all the people she met along the way.    She taught us so much about how to relax, how to smell flowers, how to welcome Spring.”
She was always on for a hug. 
Such wisdom in one so small.  We miss her every day, but her gentle spirit has never left us.”
D’artagnan  - I miss all my friends mentioned here and also Millie and Ellie  and Gizmo.
Here now is a version of “The Rainbow Bridge”
-Author Unknown
 
Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.
When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.
All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.
They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.
You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.
Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....
