Last month I just didn’t have enough space in my column to relate all the tales (tails?) of my escapades.
Now, I would not want to be typecast as a habitual runaway. I was just    born under a wandering star. 
Anyway, let’s continue on with one more story. We had gone to the Café Bones dog park with two of mum’s friends on a Saturday morning. I love café Bones! I always score one of those pupaccinos, if I just sit there looking with pleading eyes at other café-goers.  mum and her friends were talking philosophy over coffee, and I just strolled away; down the path; through   a gate a cyclist had left swinging opened; and down a side street. Suddenly,  I realised I was locked out of the park, because the gate had swung shut. So I  nonchalantly pretended to be just sniffing around.  Then I heard this man’s voice asking me , ‘Hey, are you lost?’. ‘Who? Me?’…’Maybe, I said.   Then the wife said, “he’s a guide dog’. They lived in the street  an had just returned home from a holiday.  They took me home and  fed me  and I played with their dog.  ‘Well, this could be worse’, I thought.  
Meanwhile back at Café Bones, mum and her friends were frantically looking for me, then they came home.  Then mum got a phone message from the good people who had found me: they had taken me to my vet, as his number and mum’s number were on my dog tag.
then mum and her friends came to pick me up at the vet.  It was a happy reunion and I told mum I  would never wander away again.
A few days later we went to Café Bones again and we visited my rescuers.  I knew exactly where these good people lived.
