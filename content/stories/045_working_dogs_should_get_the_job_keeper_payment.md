D’artagnan the guide dog here. The other day when I was lounging on the sofa listening to ABC radio National, I heard on the news that the government had overestimated its ‘job keeper’ budget by a whopping $60 billion dollars. So, I wrote this letter to the treasurer, the Hon Josh Frydenberg MP:

“Dear Josh,

My name is D’artagnan and I am a guide dog. The COVID-19 social distancing restrictions mean that my mum cannot get around to all the places where I used to lead her. I heard that treasury has $60.00 to spare. I have an idea on how to use it , and make the government look good: Give access to the Job keeper payment to all working dogs! Working dogs perform vital jobs each day, and yet we have been totally overlooked in the COVID-19 economic stimulus package. I have asked the Working Dog Union of Australia to campaign on our behalf. But why not just do the right thing and make an announcement that all working dogs will be eligible for the Job Keeper payment? There’s a great photo opportunity here for you! Some dogs, like those poor customs dogs who may not be needed much because flights are grounded, may need to access the Job Seeker payment. Yours sincerely, D’artagnan.”

One of mum’s NDIS support workers , Lizzie, drew a cartoon for our Job Keeper payment campaign!
This month I also received more emails to my ‘hey D’artagnan’ mailbox.

Alice shared a cartoon where this little dog is puzzling over why so many humans are wearing muzzles. He thinks they must all have bitten people!

Little Buddy here in the village wrote to say that is still not getting enough shredded chicken. The other day he followed this man who was carrying a hot roast chicken that smelled irresistibly good. The man stopped and said to Buddy , “OH, little dog, you must love me”. And Buddy wrote that he looked at the man and thought, “I will love you much more if you give me that roast chicken”. But the man didn’t get the hint. Buddy also did something else at home that prompted his mum Natalie to threaten him with eviction. This is what ‘iso’ is doing to us dogs!

But some dogs are lapping it up. little Winnie in Perth wrote and said “Hey D’artagnan. Personally, I love what coronavirus has done for me! My mummy and daddy are both working from home and that means I get so many more of pats and treats, I have even learned some new tricks! Luckily in Perth, we are still allowed to go out to the doggy park for exercise, I would go crazy without my daily walkies! My mummy has also started taking me out for some running now that her netball season has been cancelled- We ran 7 kilometres yesterday, and I am pooped! By the way, what's the deal with the toilet paper crisis? The humans could just take a leaf out of our book and use the grass! But each to their own, I suppose!”

Well, that’s my round-up for this month. Keep well everyone!
