D’artagnan the (retired) guide dog here.

Yes, that’s right, I need to get used to my “retired guide dog” status.

Aunty Pam next-door has been looking into activities I could take up in my retirement.

Frankly, I thought that retirement meant that I could just lie all day at home on the sofa or on my trampoline bed on the patio.

Anyway, Aunty Pam saw a story on TV about this mob who have come up with the idea for an enterprise called mad dogs and Englishmen Seagull patrol.

The dogs run around and chase seagulls away from diners at the Opera House restaurants, and I’m guessing their handlers stand around on the sideline not doing much and make mega bucks.

Aunty Pam thought this activity would be ideal for me.

So, I checked the Mad Dogs and Englishmen Seagull Patrol job ad.

It reads “Our trained dogs and handlers understand the behaviour of the seagulls, and know exactly what to do to keep them away. Our dogs are trained specifically to chase seagulls and are super social with people.”

The ad goes on to proclaim “Ornithophobia is a fear of birds and is something 1% of the population suffer from and the 16th biggest phobia on the planet! “

I don’t like to point out the flaw in the marketing pitch here, but, on that same human [phobia list](https://www.fearof.net/), cynophobia – the fear of dogs – ranks up there as the 5th biggest phobia on the planet!

So, uh, aren’t diners more likely to be scared of the dogs than the seagulls?

On that phobia list, I especially liked number 26: [Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia – The fear of long words](https://www.fearof.net/fear-of-long-words-phobia-hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia/)!

Anyway, seemed like a cool job so I got in touch with a couple of their seagull-chasing superstars named in the [job ad](https://www.maddogsdogwalking.com.au/seagull-patrol/), Muffin and Tauzer.

Can you believe it my good readers, Those two mongrels had the cheek to question my suitability to join the seagull Patrol?

Muffin insinuated, “I am sorry D’artagnan, but your dog breed has a certain reputation for food distraction. I fear you would be as bad as those seagulls around all that food”.

I nearly choked on the snack I was munching on. I retorted, “Oh yeah? And just how did you get your name, Muffin?”.

Needless to say, I didn’t get the job.

So, I called my seagull friend Jonathan Livingstone, and we are going to join forces and form a rival company. We will call our little enterprise the “Fee-fi-fo-fum Diners Patrol”.

We are working on our ad:

“Our trained dogs and seagulls understand the behaviour of humans and know exactly what to do to spook them away. Our dogs and seagulls are trained specifically to chase greedy-guts diners but are super social with people who share their food with dogs and seagulls.”

The plan is simple but fail-proof: Jonathan and I take a stroll to the Opera House. We let Muffin and Tauzer do their thing and chase the seagulls. Then we make our move and chase the greedy-guts diners. And then we feast on the food left on the deserted tables. And then we make our get-away….
