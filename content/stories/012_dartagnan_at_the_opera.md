Figaro, Figaro, Figaro…Lalla…Lalla…Lalla…

oh what a grand night I had at the Opera in the Domain!

Mummy’s friend Graeme came to pick us up, and Aunty Jenny from Bellflower also came with us. First we drove to Neutral Bay to meet some of mummy’s other friends, another Jennie and Alistair , and then we took a ferry across to Circular Quay and walked to the Domain.

The beautiful music, the fresh summer evening air, the big crowd, wonderful friends…and food! Mummy packed my dinner – chicken breast nuggets and those daily Brussel sprouts.

And of course mummy shared her smoked salmon rolls with me.

Aunty Jenny gave me her *broken* biscuits.

Bizet’s friendship duet from the Pearl Fishers made me dream of oysters, and the flower duet from Delibes’ Lakmé lulled me to sleep: bellisimo!

But the most special moment of the night was when the conductor of the orchestra, Brian Castles-Onion, came over to where we were sitting and asked mum if he could pat me. Mum said ‘yes’ because I was not working and I had my harness off (for my comfort). Then Brian Castles-Onion asked mummy if the music would not bother me, bless his soul for being so thoughtful and worrying about my delicate ears. And he talked about his dogs and so on. Then he said he loved me! Oh gosh! And now and then when he was conducting, I am quite sure he pointed his baton at me….
