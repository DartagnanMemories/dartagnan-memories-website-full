I learnt a new word the other day: ‘Leptospirosis’.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that causes haemorrhages, organ failure and swelling of the brain and is potentially fatal to both dogs and humans.

It spreads through contact with infected rats or through rats’ urine. One source of the infection is rats’ urine contaminated water in puddles and ponds.

You dirty rats!? Now I cannot enjoy a dip and a sip in a puddle, for fear that you pee-peed in it?
And to add to this spoiling of my fun, I had to suffer the ignominy of a jab in my toochie to protect me against the deadly infection.

And I didn’t see that jab coming. Mum took me to the vet, and I barged in there like I always do. He’s the vet who said I was a ‘legend’ when I ate those 24 rice balls. This time he said, ‘just a little pinch’ Ouch.
Why jab me? Why not jab all those little rats?

Seriously, though, my vet said that the Australian Veterinary Association and Sydney University Veterinary Hospital are recommending dogs in the Inner West be vaccinated against this disease. Two vaccinations, two to four weeks apart, are required for adequate cover.

In an article published in the Guardian on 19 July, Prof Jacqueline Norris, an expert in veterinary medicine from the University of Sydney, said vets were grappling with the disease.

“We’ve never had leptospirosis,” Norris said. “Now we’ve got seven fatalities in three months.”

I feel so sad for those dogs from Surry Hills, Darlinghurst and Glebe who contracted the disease. All died.
My vet says one of the best ways to minimise the spread is to vaccinate dogs in the areas surrounding those suburbs.
