D’artagnan the guide dog here.  My mum went for Yum Cha  with friends at a restaurant in the city and left me here with Aunty Pam next door. Well, I always enjoy my stays at Aunty Pam.  We share   mandarins, crisp and cheese and crackers, and she takes me for puddles  and here and there in the  village.  But at 5 pm I had to remind Aunty Pam it was my dinner time.  I mean, Aunty Pam was sitting there immobile with my tin of Campbell chicken and vegetables soup in one hand and the tin opener in the other.    She was watching a vet show on TV and was  entranced  by this story about a constipated snake. I had to whack her with my paw’s elbow to get her attention.  “Wait a minute,” said Aunty Pam.  “I want to know what the vet is going  to do about the  constipated  snake”.  
“Uh,” I said, “Why can’t the vet just Give the snake a laxative?  What about my rumbling stomach?”.
But just at that minute the doorbell rang. It  was mum.  And she had brought home a container with delicious smelling food.  
Oh,” I thought:  should I have the soup or the Yum cha left-overs?  
Can I have both , mum?”
“NO,” said mum, in that tone of voice   that dogs know means “no.”.
So, I had the Yum Cha left-overs:  dumplings of all sorts and one prawn (Yes, greedy lot only left me 1 prawn!).
It got me thinking: Could the village social committee please arrange a Yum Cha feast for the dogs of the village?
Volunteers could push trolleys and serve the village dogs such delicacies as chicken wings and claws, steamed pork buns,  succulent prawns and squid,  lots of dumplings,  dim sims,     roast duck  and much more.     There could also be a selection of pet treats for those dogs whose palate  may not be accustomed to my fancy taste buds.  For dessert, little custard egg tarts would be perfect. I only had a tiny bit of a taste of the one mum brought home that day.  Mum’s excuse was that it was not good for me. “Bah,” I said: I doubt it’s good for you, mum”.
I think also it would be a good idea if a restaurant for dogs opened up somewhere, as it’s not fair that us dogs should sit there under the table while humans enjoy scrumptious food.
The Yum Cha for dogs idea could catch on!    So, c’mon social committee, let’s plan a Yum Cha for dogs event here in the village!
Moved by D’artagnan and    unanimously seconded by the dogs of the village.  Typed by Gisele.
