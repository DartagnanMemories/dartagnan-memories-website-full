D’artagnan the guide dog here.  I hope all my village friends had a good Christmas, despite that COVID thing still lurking around. My mum and her brother have kept a French tradition of having a Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve. Mum had ordered turkey rissoles for my dinner    from Coles Online, but they were out of stock, so Coles delivered chicken and cheese patties instead.  
Mum said, “That’s not quite the same”.  
But I said, “It’s still a notch up from my usual tin of sardine, mum”.  
So that was that and mum served the chicken patties to me with little potatoes.  “NO Brussel sprouts?,” I hear you ask. NO. But I heard on ABC Radio that Brussel sprouts   have now made their way onto Christmas tables!
Then when mum and her brother were having their dinner, I managed to score 3 oysters (1 of which had dropped on the floor so was mine anyway), 4 prawns and an assortment of other delicacies.  All good things come to those who sit and wait, I have learned in my lifetime. 
On Christmas Day we visited friends in Ingleburn and the food feat continued.  Turkey, ham , more prawns , roast potatoes and roast pumpkin  etc.  And this family have 4 children. They chase me around and I chase   them.  We had so much fun! I didn’t want to go home.  But well, we did come home, and the feat was over.  Mum said, “NO dinner tonight booboo.  We have had too much today”.  
“We?,” I  asked.  
Anyway, mum just made a cup of tea and I had my warm milk and a biscuit  and then off to bed.   
Ah but I did get gifts!  I got a cool mat from Aunty Pam next door  for hot Summer days; a bag of speciality dog biscuits from Aunty Robyn ; a bag of greenies   from Uncle Tim and Aunty Dot; a bag of duck treats from Aunty Jenny. From mum I got two new toys of the kind I love so much:  soft furry toys that squeak and that I can HOLD IN MY MUZZLE.  One was in the shape of a doughnut and the other of a slice of pizza.  It got me thinking: Wouldn’t it be a cool idea to make edible toys?  I am only thinking about waste-reduction and the environment, of course.
Good wishes for 2021 everyone!
