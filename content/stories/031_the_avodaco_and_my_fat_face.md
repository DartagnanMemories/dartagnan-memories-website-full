D’artagnan the guide dog here.

You all know that scene from Oliver Twist when Oliver holds up his bowl and asks, “Please, Sir, I want some more”.

Okay, I get a little more than thin gruel for my daily meals. But I get tired of my daily Brussel sprouts and I would starve if I didn’t scrounge for extra food on our walks.

Trouble is, mum seems to know when I find stuff in the street. Or some do-gooder will stop and say, “what you got there D’artagnan’?

Then they go tell mum that I got a bread roll, or a banana, or a juicy piece of watermelon.

Dibber dobbers!

Anyway, this one time on our block walk I had made it almost all the way home with my prize.

Then I heard our neighbour Pam ask, ‘What’s the matter with D’artagnan’s face?”.

I bowed my head, thinking, ‘Oh no”.

“Show me,” Says Aunty Pam, in that nurse voice of hers.

“No,” I said, resolutely snap locking my teeth.

Pam got all worried and said my face looked all swollen.

“yes, I thought , “let us go home and my face will get better”

 But Aunty Pam and mum both bent over me and felt my fat face. Then they took it from me…my avocado.

Well it had been a little bit of a challenge keeping that avocado hidden in my muzzle.

And then Aunty Pam and mum had a bit of a conversation about how avocados are not good for dogs, how I could have swallowed the stone and it could have been stuck in me and I Could have had to have surgery.
Oh, the drama. And I had to sit there eyeing that avocado in Aunty Pam’s hand.
