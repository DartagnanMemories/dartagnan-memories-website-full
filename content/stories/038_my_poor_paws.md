D’artagnan the guide dog here.  Okay, I really wanted to talk about something else than COVID for my column this month, but it’s the talk of the moment so I may as well join-in the chorus.    
So, Gladys and Kerry say its okay for us to exercise.  Mum has interpreted this to mean we should go on long walks most days. Now, I do love my walks at Sydney Park, black Wattle Bay, cook’s River and Yeo Park.  But since Greater Sydney went into lockdown, I am now being walked off my poor paws almost every day!    
And, instead of our 2 block walks each day, we are now doing three!
And I am not the only dog complaining about this excess:  every dog I meet on our walks has the same tale about their humans using them as an excuse to be out and about.
And if I drag my paws a little, mum or her walking companion push me from behind  (Oh the indignity! ) and say “c’mon, we are nearly at the car”.  Phooey: I have learned that “nearly at the car”  means like a country mile away!  And then when we get to the car, I have to “leap” into the back seat.  Hey, I am11, that’s 88 in human years, for goodness sake!
And my figure! I had that typical Labrador paunch but now I have lost so many kilos I am starting to look like a greyhound. Pam next door says I look Trim taut and terrific.    Okay, that should make me feel good, but with nowhere to go to show off my new physique, what is the point of looking good?
And I am missing out on my sofa naps. 
Oh well.  I guess I should not complain because some people and dogs are really doing it hard in the lockdown , and we are doing okay.
But get on board the vaccine strategy everyone so that life can get back to some form of normal and I can rest my poor paws again!
In closing my column this month, I want to say a few words in memory of my dear doggie friend Millie, who passed away recently aged only 7. When Millie’s mum took all of us to the park for exercise, Millie would always look after my mum while her mum would go look for me when I wandered away And Millie would love to leap -up and sneak a kiss to my mum.  I used to get jealous about that, but then I realised Millie was just being…Millie.  One day when we were at Sydney Park, Millie and I wandered away and  into bushes and we found some delightfully smelling human poo.  We had a ripper time rolling in it.  But when we came back to our mums,   for some reason we both got into trouble.  Millie, I will miss you and so will my mum. Rest in peace.
