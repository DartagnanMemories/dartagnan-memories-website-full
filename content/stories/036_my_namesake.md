D’artagnan the guide dog here.

My kennel name was Jester. Don’t laugh. The Guide Dogs naming convention is to use different letters of the alphabet for each litter. I was in a “J” litter, and some clown decided to name me “jester”.
Mum decided to call me D’artagnan.

Some people say, “oh, that’s too long for a dog’s name”. Others try to say Dar…Dar… Dar but can’t quite spit it out.

But those who know the origin of my name, excitedly talk about the three musketeers and try to recall all their names: Aramis, Athos and Porthos.

Mum explains that d’Artagnan was in fact a real personage in French history: Charles de Batz de Castelmore d’Artagnan (1611-1673), or Count d’Artagnan.

He was a young, poor noble, who served the French King , Louis XIV, as Capitaine of the Musketeers of the Guard. The French author Alexandre Dumas popularised the exploits of d’Artagnan and Aramis, Athos and Porthos in his book , “The Three Musketeers” and sequel books.

But Dumas drew inspiration from a novel by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras “Les memoirs de M. d’Artagnan”

The other day at Black Wattle Bay, when a workman heard my name being called out, he exclaimed, “d’Artagnan!”. I overheard him asking mum if she gave me that name because I was dashing”. Mum said, “yes”. My chest puffed up. Then mum added, ”and also because he is a bit of a rebel”. I looked around, incredulous : “Moi?”. But the workman said, “Oh, me too. I like that!”. So, I thought , “Okay, dashing and a rebel. “What else?”. But mum forgot to add d’Artagnan’s other quality she usually mentions to people: d’Artagnan was loyal.

So That’s my story. Many just call me Mr D.
