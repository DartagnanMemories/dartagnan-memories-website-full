Disclaimer: I humbly apologise to author Alexander McCall Smith for this tongue-in-cheek spin-off on his popular book series. Please don’t sue me: D’artagnan the guide dog.

This month I thought I would relate this incident from a little while ago.

So, I had picked up a discarded piece of chicken I had found on one of my walks around the block with my mum .

I had eaten most of it by the time mum realised and tried to prise the rest of the chicken out of my mouth.

Then I didn’t feel too good but didn’t know why. Anyway, we went shopping with mum and a friend. And there, in the middle of the Westfield mall, I had this urge ‘to go’. So, I did.

Mum’s friend saw there was blood and bones in my no. 2.

So after a quick clean up, we were off to the vet.

Diagnosis: Chicken bone injury. Overnight at the vet. $660.00.

The vet told mum to watch for blood in my no. 2 for a few days. So mum had to hire the services of the no.2 Detective Agency: neighbours Mma Carmel Wall and Mma Eileen O’Mullane.

Every day for four days, in the early hours of the morning and at night, Carmel and Eileen accompanied my mum and me on our block walk, armed with a torch.

They waited patiently as I found the ‘right spot’ to do my do’s.

And then they stooped down to inspect my no. 2’s. All good.

 By the way, did you know scientists only recently discovered dogs pooped along the north-south axis of the Earth’s magnetic field ?

Well, just what did they think we were doing when we were pivoting around on our daily walkies ?

Anyway, thank you to the two lovely ladies from the no. 2 Ladies Detective Agency for looking after me and my mum.
