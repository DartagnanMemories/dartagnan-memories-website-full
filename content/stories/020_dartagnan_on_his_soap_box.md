D’artagnan the guide dog here.  
President trump has twitter to huff and puff on the issues of the day:  I have the Grapevine.
So here is my op ed for this month.
First, I didn’t get a reply from the treasurer Josh Frydenberg to my letter suggesting working dogs like me should get the job keeper payment.
And now the Prime Minister Scott  Morrison has added a ‘job maker’ payment to the COVID-19 -economic recovery package. 
Well, Scomo, let me help you out with a new line of job incentives:  I call it ‘job faker’.
This would be a payment to all the people who pretend to work but do bugger all. 
Now, that’s not me, of course.  Even when I am lounging on the sofa, I am working.  I am thinking.  Thinking is 90% of the job.
For example, this past month I gave a lot of thought to the Stockland budget.
I voted  ‘NO’ for the following reasons: 
-A three-fold increase in Insurance cost, but no pet insurance cover.
No allocation for a dog paddle pool.
No allocation for dog treats and other necessities.
No pet grooming service.
No fenced dog exercise area with play equipment and poo bags dispenser.

Thank you to all the residents who supported my above concerns and voted ‘NO’ with me.
I will finish my post this month on a happy note.  Little Buddy the dog emailed me this story. He was walking with his mum Natalie when she twisted her ankle and had to wobble home. Little Buddy writes that he decided to copy her, half out of sympathy, half out of fun.  No less than 2 passers-by stop them along the way and informed Natalie that her dog  (Buddy) had a sore paw and was limping.  None of the passers-by took any notice that it was Natalie that had a sore foot and that Buddy was faking it!  
Buddy wrote that it was one of those roll-on- the-floor-laughing moment.  ROLF!
