I racked my dog’s brain out for a Christmas-theme  topic for my column this month.  
“Ah,” I thought,  “my toy box!”
I have toys with holes meant for inserting treats.  Alas, I have peered into those holes and sniffed and dug, but no treats to be found.
I have tug-o-war      rope toys.  They are pretty threadbare because I have to pull so hard to yank them out of mum’s grip.
I have a yellow ball with a little bell inside. I like to play fetch but once in a while, I would like to be the one to throw the ball and  yell “fetch”!
And I have lots of squeaky toys! Squeaky rubbery bones; a squeaky rubbery throw stick;  squeaky ball and pull toys; and lots of squeaky furry animals! I love my squeaky toys! 
I figured out that they are a sure fire  way to get mum’s attention.
If mum is having a nap, I get one of my squeaky toy from my toy box and poke it into mum and I make a racket until she gets up.
If mum is busy at the computer and is ignoring me, same M.O. 
And if we have guests and I feel left out, ditto.
I have a snake and a platypus and a cow and many other animals, but most of them are missing ears and paws and other bits, so it’s a little hard to say what they once were!
And I have this rubbery pig. It oinks. Now, that pig gives me the heebie-jeebies. I once gave one just like it away to this little boy who liked it so much. I thought, “good riddance” . But would you believe that this do-gooder who heard of my good deed went to buy me the same scary pig?!
