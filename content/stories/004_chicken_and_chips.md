Our neighbour Pam surprises us occasionally with home-cooked chips, piping hot just out of her 	oven, wrapped in greaseproof paper. 
A few weeks ago, Aunty Pam rang the doorbell  and said  , “put your  hand out,” and handed mum hot chips.  Then Aunty Pam went to Marie’s door, the other neighbour,  to also give her some hot chips.
A few minutes later Marie appeared at our door and told us that Pam had had a fall.  So, mum put me on the leash, and we went to  see what we could do to help. 
Aunty Pam was sitting on the ground and Marie and mum tried to help her up.  Just then I spotted hot chips that Aunty Pam had dropped on the ground. So, I decided to make a bee-line for those hot chips, which meant I had to step over Aunty Pam.
“Ouch,” said Aunty Pam “Get off me you big lump of lard!” (it’s one of Pam’s endearing phrases for me).
“But” I protested, “those chips are getting cold on the ground”.   
Then after getting the chips, of course I had to step back over Aunty Pam.
Mum roused on me and dragged me back indoors, then called the INS, who called an ambulance to attend to Aunty Pam.
The ambulance officers came and helped Aunty Pam up and checked her over.
I heard one of them ask Aunty Pam, “Do you know where you are?”
“Yes,” she said, “I’m sitting on the ground!…” (That cracked me up!)
Then I heard mum tell the ambulance officers that I was at home because of my bad behaviour.  And the man ambulance officer asked if he could come to see me.
I expected a lecture, but he said sympathetically, Hello there boy: I hope you didn’t burn your tongue on those hot chips?” “.


“Uh,  a little,” I feigned.  
So, he gave me a soothing pat and said “There , there”.
Meanwhile Aunty Pam asked the woman ambulance officer who had stayed with her , “Where is the other officer?”
And the woman ambulance officer told Pam that he had gone over to visit me.
And Aunty Pam said, “Why? There  is nothing wrong with D’artagnan! I’m the one who had a fall and the big lump of lard stepped over me!”
It seems I upset a few sods in the village this month. My little friend Buddy wrote me to demand why Aunty Jenny had given me duck treats for Christmas , when she had only given him chicken treats.
“But you love  chicken , Buddy!”, I said.
“That’s not the point, D’artagnan.  And you know it: Duck trumps chicken in the good food guide!”, said Buddy.
“Na-na na-na booboo" I said.
