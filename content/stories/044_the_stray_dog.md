Warning: sad story.

One morning when mum took me for a walk at 5 am to do my business, a big dog punced on me. He was sniffing me all over, mounting me , growling and barking. My mum called for help but no one came out. I broke free of the other dog and started walking fast with my mum, with the other dog in pursuit. We made it home and got inside and kept the other dog out. Mum called Ashfield police and when they came the other dog ran away. The police said it was a brown and white staffie or pitbull. After the police left the dog came back again at our door and at 6 am mum called the rangers. Then Pam came out because the other dog kept barking and whimpering. He stayed at our door for over 2 hours. Then he left and later the rangers called and said they caught him. The next day my mum called to inquire about him. The dog was microchipped and they had messaged his owner in Ashbury, but the owner had not returned their messages. It was a very scary experience for my mum and me and I tried to be brave an protect my mum, but I feel sad for the other dog and I hope his owner claims him or a kind person gives him a home.
