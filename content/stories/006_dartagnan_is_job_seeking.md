D’artagnan the guide dog here.  
With this COVID-19 pandemic still limiting my normal guide dog activities, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg has said that I need to job search for alternative work.
So I am reaching out to the village community to find suitable work:

Job wanted

Day and night food spillage clean up service
I Have a reference from our neighbour Pam who writes, “I have no hesitation in recommending D’artagnan as a cleaner-upper for all your food spillage incidents.  There will be not a morsel or crumb or drop left behind.  No job too big or too small. 100% satisfaction guaranteed.  Cash in paw or direct deposit”
As for volunteering,  I would like to put up my paw as the doggie rep on the residents committee. The pets of this village need a voice! Just as an example, when my mum got a ‘care bag’ from Stockland,  I put my head in the bag and found 2 tea bags, 2 coffee bags, 2 lollies and 2 left-over-from-the panic-stockpiling toilet rolls.  And for me?  Zilch! Would it have been too much to chuck-in 2 treats and, say, 2 poo bags in the ‘care bag’?
This sort  of discrimination has led the pets of the village to take direct action.  For instance Charlie brown,  a 13 year old black Spoodle who lives    in Camelia, emailed me to share this story:
“Hey D’artagnan.  Charlie Brown here. The other day my mum Jan took me to visit my new dog-sitter, Jenny.  I was familiarizing myself with the  apartment, and found half a chocolate chip cookie and finished it off.  Well, Dart, you should have heard the Tim Tam they made over that half a biscuit!   Who would give half a biscuit to a guest?”
And Poogie the Belgian Barge Dog in Rylstone voiced his solidarity: “Woof woof D'art.  With the help of my carer neighbour, Helen, I read your latest newsletter with solemnity.   How terrible that living and working in your luxurious home, management does not supply those doggy necessities which would make life much better for you!“
 And there were more letters in my mailbox. But I want to devote my closing words to my friend Ellie, who passed away this month.  Ellie and I have been play mates at the dog park each week  for the past 8 years. Her dad Tim would come to pick up my mum and me each week and Ellie and I would enjoy our time running around and sniffing and other doggie pursuits.   Ellie loved pats and I let my mum pat her and didn’t get jealous. I will miss you Ellie. Rest in Peace.
