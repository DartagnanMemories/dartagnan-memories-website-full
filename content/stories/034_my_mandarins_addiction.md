D’artagnan the guide dog here. Yes, it’s true: I am addicted to that delectable, juicy, heavenly-smelling fruit: mandarins.

You see, it started when I first came to live with mum in 2011. I figured out that the best way to get mum to share her food with me was to never say “no”.

One day mum was eating a fruit and I put on my little pleading act.

Mum: “It’s a mandarin D’artagnan. You won’t like it”

Me: “Oh mum, pretty please”.

Mum: “Okay”

And with that mum gave me a segment of her mandarin.

Oh.my.gosh I nearly spat it out, pips and all. But remembering my “never say no” game-plan, I said, “Oh I love mandarins”.

And, eventually, the lie became the truth.

When mum and I were sitting one day outside the Council chambers in Ashfield eating mandarins, a man called out , “Hey there , Mandarin boy”.

The name stuck.

And by the next mandarins season, I had one of the shop assistants at Coles peeling mandarins from the display to feed to me.

I had to admit it then: I was a mandarins addict.

When I stay over at my neighbour Pam’s place, Aunty Pam always has a mandarin for me. Oh, but Aunty Pam sits there picking out every pip of every segment. It’s enough to send a mandarin addicted dog to the clinic.

And one day we were at a railway station and mum said “find the steps’. Oh, but I caught the whiff of a mandarin someone was eating way on the other side of the concourse. So, I dragged mum all the way to where the man was sitting and sat down and begged. I got my fix and then found my way to the steps to our platform.

And another time we were walking along Holden St and there it was again: that irresistible whiff. There was this house with this open door and workmen having mandarins for lunch. So, I barged into the house with mum saying, “Where are you going D’artagnan?”. Anyway after a few words of explanation from mum, that mandarin was mine.
