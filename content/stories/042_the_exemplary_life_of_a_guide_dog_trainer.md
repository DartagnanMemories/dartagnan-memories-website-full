D’artagnan the guide dog here. 
Mum and I were invited recently to celebrate the 80th birthday of our guide dog instructor, Ray Joyce. 
Before I came  to live with mum  at the village, mum lived in Milson’s Point with another guide dog, named Katie.  Mum often tells me stories about Katie. I hear she was super intelligent  (like me); gorgeous  (like me; and a little devil (Like…uh?).

Anyway, things didn’t end too well, and Katie had to retire at 4.  
Then guide dog instructor Ray Joyce came into mum’s life and he thought I would be  a perfect match for mum.
That was in September 2011. 
So, Ray became our trainer.
Ray was an old hand at this job.  He worked for over 50 years as a guide dog   trainer. It all started when he was just   a young chap trying to find a job.  His brothers saw an add in a newspaper for a guide dog trainer  , and said, “What about this?). Ray had lived on a farm and loved dogs and a challenge.  Ray had been a Queen’s Scout.  So, he applied. The interviewer  had also been a scout.   Ray got the job and went on to train hundreds of guide dogs and their handlers.  Ray  is the oldest living guide dog trainer in the entire world.
And mum and I were the only handler and guide dog team invited to celebrate his 80th birthday with his lovely partner Jan and his family and Jan’s  family.
There were slides tracing Ray’s life from boyhood to working life and retirement.
Then we shared stories.
Mum recounted the story of the time when she called Ray for assistance with dealing with these little dogs that lived in Clissold street.  The little terrors would come out of their gate, race across the street  and circle around us each time we walked past. 
So, Ray came, and we all walked to Clissold St.  As we approached the little terrors’ house, Ray said to mum “Do not yell at the dogs.  Let me handle this”.   
So, on cue, the little terrors came out of their gate, raced across the street and Ray yelled out at the top of his voice “Go home you mutts. Get away”.   
Mum whispered to Ray. “But you told me not to yell”.
Ray said something about it all being in the delivery.
Anyway, the dog owner came out and Ray and the owner had a bit of a conversation.  
I think the whole street had heard the commotion and came out.
And the little terrors never ever bothered us again!
You were a super friend to  people and dogs alike,  (except to little terrors)Ray.  
I only have one quibble: I could never get away with doing anything wrong when you were training us! 
You will always be a special person in mum’s life and mine.
