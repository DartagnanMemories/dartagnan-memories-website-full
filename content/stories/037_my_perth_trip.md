D’artagnan the guide dog here.  In February mum had to go to Perth to attend a conference on digital accessibility. So here we were at Sydney Airport with Aunty Robyn and Aunty Jo, and mum decides I should go have one last pipi before boarding the plane. Well Sydney Airport has just built a  new indoor “Assistant dogs’ toilet”. That’s very considerate.  But Aunty Jo opened the door and I stepped in and  thought, “Oh no”.  It’s the size of a shower cubicle and it has fake grass and …a fake red fire hydrant!  “Uh, I’ll hold”, I said.  Of course, I had no idea that Perth was on the other side of Australia.
Now we are on the plane.  Mum had told everyone I had my own  window seat. She didn’t explain to me  that this was only so no one sat in that seat.  I had to lie on the floor!
In Perth we were met by a lovely young woman named Tabitha, whom mum had recruited on the Hireup platform to assist us during our stay. 
We stayed at a place called Durham Lodge.  The hostess there, Lynn, was      also very nice and had a little dog named Millie.  
Then the next day we went to the conference.  
After the conference ended Tabitha came to pick us up.  I decided I wanted to ride in the front with mum.  But when Tabitha  was driving off, I changed my mind and decided I would hop in the backseat. But I misjudged the  space between the two front seats ,  And I got wedged in there.  So here I was, stuck.  Out the rear window of the car, I could see other cars queuing up behind us and could hear a lot of horns tooting. Did I mention we were blocking the exit of the parking lot and it was 5 pm? Anyway, Tabitha and mum were trying to push and pull me back and forth.     Finally, I came unstuck.
Then we went to the swan River where we met up with Tabitha’s partner, Jeremy, and their cutie-pie  little dog, Winnie.  We had take-away burgers and chips by the river and then went for a walk.  The weather was perfect, and we had a wonderful evening with our new friends in Perth.
When we got back to Sydney, Aunty Alex was waiting for us and she had a bottle of water for me and a bowl. So, I had a big drink.  “Pipi, D’artagnan?”  “yes please, I’m busting”.  Then Aunty Alex opened the door to the assistant dog’s toilet…I turned my snout up, did an about turn and made them walk me to real grass.
