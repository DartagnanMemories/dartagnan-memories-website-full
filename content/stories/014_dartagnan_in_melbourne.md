 As a guide dog I get to go everywhere my mum goes.

On the weekend of 18-19 August I flew with mum and a friend named Tarryn to Melbourne. I didn’t like the flight much; I prefer trains.

But I loved the hotel! I slept on mum’s bed. It had a super cosy doona and the hotel gave me a soft warm blanket.

I was in heaven!

Mum had packed some chicken nuggets and a sweet potato for my dinner. For breakfast I had hot porridge and apple-blueberry-pear baby food. Oh yum!

I walked with my mum to the gardens next to Victorian Parliament House so I could do my daily poo-poos there: it was the perfect spot!

On Sunday we met a delightful young boy named Toby Little and his parents. Mum had come to Melbourne especially to meet Toby. When he was only five Toby asked his mum if he could write to someone in every country in the world. Before he had turned 6, Toby had already written to people in all 193 member countries of the UN, and even to a research scientist in Antarctica! When he was 8 he recorded a letter for my mum and me because he knew mum would not be able to read his letter. He is now 10 and has written over 1,250 letters by hand, and some have been published in a book called “Dear World”.

I had a great time playing with Toby on the banks of the Yarra River!
