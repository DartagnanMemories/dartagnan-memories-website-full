D’artagnan the guide dog here.

Everyone and their dog are talking about “the new normal”.

People are shopping online rather than going to the shops. They are remote working and remote learning from home using computers.

Mum and I used to take the train to the city and go to the WEA community college to do courses on philosophy, literature and other interesting subjects. I sat with mum in all the classes and learned a lot and at break time we had mandarins and then lunch in the library room.

Now mum is doing all these classes from home at her computer and I am missing out on the outing, the learning and the morning tea and lunch breaks.

We used to go to all these conferences in the city and even to Melbourne and Perth.

We stayed in hotels with beds made up with soft doonas in which I could snuggle in and sleep so nicely. And in the mornings we had yummy breakfasts with room service, and we went for walks in new places and it was so much fun.

Now mum just clicks a Zoom link on her computer, and we are in the conference without going anywhere.
We used to go to the Ensemble Theatre in Kirribilli and watched plays and then have a picnic in the park and I would enjoy a dip in the harbour at the boat ramp.

Now mum watches plays and concerts at her computer and there is nothing for me to do but flop on the sofa.

I’m getting fat and bored.

And it gets worse…The other day one of mum’s friends said she had gone on a virtual trip to Spain on her computer.

So, mum got the idea that we could have virtual visits to the dog park.

She sat at her computer and said, “Watch this D’artagnan”.

Click click click and black Wattle Bay appeared on the computer screen. That is where we go with mum’s friends each week, and where I can run around in the fresh air and have a swim and sniff the mouth-watering harbour smells and find food scraps in the picnic areas and play with other dogs.

Now I could see all of that scenery on the computer screen, but I sat there wondering “how do I pop over there?”

And mum said, “Virtual is the new normal, Booboo” ( that’s mum’s pet name for me).

I’m so sad. I don’t like this new virtual normal.

My wish to everyone and every dog in the village and the world is that in 2021 we will once again be able to safely take part with one and other in real life interactions and activities that bring us so much pleasure.
