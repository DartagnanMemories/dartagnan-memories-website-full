D’artagnan the guide dog here.  For my first column in 2020, I thought I would share my New Year’s resolutions.
When I meet people from the village in my daily walks around the block, they make comments such as: “Hey D’artagnan, I read your column: what  a naughty boy you are “.
Or, “G’day D’artagnan: have you gone AWOL lately?” 
Or “ Ah, here’s D’artagnan: do you have an avocado stuck in your muzzle today, boy?”.
Clearly, if that’s the impressions my readers have of me, I need to change my ways.
So here goes. Forthwith  :
I will behave impeccably. 
I will not wander off. 
I will not pick up any avocados, bread rolls, chicken drumsticks or any other  food  in the street or at the park.
I will not chop-off the head of any chocolate Easter bunnies at the supermarket.
I will not take mum to the butcher shop when she says “Find the bank”
 And I will also  not roll over on my back and refuse to move when we are in the queue at the bank.
I will not jump into the Cook’s River and shake muddy water on everybody when they pull me out.
I will not try to hump that angry Pitbull at the dog park.
  I will not jump on mum’s bed and lie on her pillow when she goes to the toilet during the night. 
I will not pull mum here and there or refuse to go home when we go for our walks.
I will not pretend to not hear when mum calls my name.
I will not kick dirt all over me after mum has given me a bath.
all these resolutions I will faithfully carry out in 2020…when pigs fly!
Happy New Year everyone!
