D’artagnan the guide dog here.  
It’s budget time again in the village. I read the proposed budget with much anticipation that the ideas I had raised  last year would have been included in this 2021-2022 forecast, but  once again the village dogs have been overlooked.
So, I am going to use my column this month to again promote our manifesto.
Last month I wrote about my upcoming retirement from my guide dog duties.  My little friend Buddy from the village read my article and suggested that there was a need for Stockland to build serviced kennels for dogs like me.  “This is a retirement village after all,” Buddy said.
This serviced kennels estate could include a meal preparation and delivery service;  reverse cycle air conditioning for year-round comfort; a barbecue area ( that goes without saying); and a fenced dog park with play equipment, trees and a pond for swimming.   
Yes, if human residents can have a gym and a pool,  why not us? 
So, I say, ditch the payroll tax contribution and let’s add  a budget item line for the dogs of the village and for other dogs who may want to come an live here in their retirement.
There would of course be a need to have a maintenance service to pick up our daily deposits.     And also, to keep those mice who are making a nuisance of themselves in rural towns out of our habitat. Perhaps the cats of the village could have that job. 
How much would it all cost? Hey, I’m a guide dog, not an accountant!   ,
