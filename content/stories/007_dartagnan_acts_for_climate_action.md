D’artagnan the guide dog here.

On Friday 20 September, mum and I trotted off to the city with friend Adele to attend the climate action rally at the Domain. It was massive! Young and old came together to support the school children who were calling for action to reduce the impact of climate change. It was a very festive atmosphere with lots of music, singing and chanting. “What do we want?’, one young girl sang out. And a chorus of voices answered, “climate action!”. Over and over again. It was so inspiring to listen to these young voices speaking out. And at the same time, it was sort of heart-wrenching that it had come to this , where children had to take the lead in taking action to safeguard their future. There were lots of people holding placards. One placard depicted a school report card scoring the government’s policies on the climate: a big fat ‘F’. One little girl stood on the stage and told the crowd, “When I make a mess, mum makes me clean it up”. Her message was clear: adults should clean up their mess too. A group of school children were chanting “If you breathe air: *you* should care’” And another group was chanting “Coal, don’t dig it: our planet is not for profit”. Then we marched off to Hyde Park, with more singing and chanting along the way. Children, teachers and parents and others all joining the march. Police officers on horses were watching.

“What do we want?”…”Climate action!”… “When do we want it?” …”Now!”.

I had very tired paws when we got home, but I felt good that I had done my little bit to save the planet.
