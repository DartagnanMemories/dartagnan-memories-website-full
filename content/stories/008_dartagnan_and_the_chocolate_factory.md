D’artagnan the guide dog here.

I didn’t get any takers to the ad I posted a few weeks ago in the Grapevine for a cleaner-upper service.

Anyway, one night when our neighbour Pam couldn’t sleep, she heard one of those news story that only makes it to the wee hours radio news: There had been a ventilation system malfunction at a Lindt and Sprüngli chocolate factory in Olten, Switzerland, between Zurich and Basel.

The malfunction had caused fragments of crushed cocoa called “cocoa nibs” to spread in the immediate vicinity of the factory, with strong winds carrying chocolate powder to settle like snow in streets, on cars, on windows and everywhere.

It was my dream clean-up job!

Then reality hit: COVID-19.

So, let’s check the Smart Traveller app.

“Border closures, quarantine, lock-down, curfew, social distancing, testing, contact tracing, paw sanitiser, mandatory mask-wearing , fines…oh wait, that’s Melbourne.

Ah, here’s Switzerland: “recommendation: avoid all nonessential international travel to Switzerland.”

Me: “Hey, SIRI , I want to go to Switzerland to clean-up cocoa nibs. Would that be deemed “essential travel”?

SIRI: No, D’artagnan.

Me: Hey, what do you know anyway?

SIRI: I know everything

So Totally ignoring SIRI’s haughty retort, I got on a flight to Zurich, and train to Basel and Olten. And there was not a single cocoa nib anywhere. The dogs of Switzerland had licked it all off. My head and tail drooped. Then I heard a voice calling out, “Hey D’artagnan!”. ” I raised my head and there he was: Willy Wonka!

He said, “Follow me”. Tail wagging, I followed him, and we arrived at the chocolate factory. Milk chocolate. Dark chocolate Hazelnut chocolate. Oh, so much chocolate!

Then I heard mum’s voice. “Hey D’artagnan. Wake up you sleepy head.”

And so, I got out of bed. And we went for our morning walk around the block.
