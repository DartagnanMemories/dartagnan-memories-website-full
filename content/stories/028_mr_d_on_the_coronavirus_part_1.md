D’artagnan the guide dog here.

What’s going on?

I was supposed to have a party for my 10th birthday in March. But then mum ‘postponed’ it.
And we were supposed to go to the WEA and to the Ensemble Theatre , and that all got cancelled. My job as a guide dog is to take mum to all such activities and to the shops and so on, but there are fewer and fewer places we can go.

My friend Alice emailed me the other day and wrote:

“Hey D’artagnan, what’s going on? My mum gets the Sydney Morning Herald delivered and until last week it was delivered rolled up in plastic wrap and thrown onto the front lawn (or garden, depending on the thrower). Ever since I was a puppy ( I’m 12 now) when mum asked, ‘Where’s the paper?’ I found it and put my paw on it. Well, last week I could not find that rolled-up newspaper anywhere. Then mum pointed to this flat object packed in plastic. I looked at mum and said, ‘What are you talking about, that’s not the paper. The paper comes rolled up.’ Anyway, I took a peek at the headline. Do you know what’s up with this rush to buy toilet paper?”.

So, I emailed Alice and wrote, “Hey Alice. I have no idea why they flattened the newspaper. As for the rush on toilet paper, yes, I read about that too. Mum had me walk to the mall at 6.30 am the other morning so we could queue up for toilet paper. You see, Alice, this Coronavirus thing has scared the poo out of all the humans in the whole world, so they need lots and lots of toilet paper.”

Then I got an email from my little friend Buddy here in the village. He wrote, “Hi D’artagnan. What’s going on? My mum usually gets chicken to mix into my meatloaf. This week, no chicken. I sniffed my plate and walked away.”

So, I wrote back:

“Hi Buddy. Yes, well my mum usually gives me Brussel sprouts with my sardines. But apparently, they are scarce too now. Humans have been buying big freezers and have stockpiled on chickens and Brussel sprouts to last them till the end of winter.”

And I also got SMS messages from my running exercise friends, Maggie, Ellie and Millie. They are all worried the government will close down dog parks because our humans come there in groups too.
So, I want to reach out to all my doggie friends in the village and the neighbourhood.
Word is that we all must make sacrifices to stop the Coronavirus. This includes ‘social distancing’. this means changing age-old habits. I know, I know: the 1.5 m apart rule means no more butt sniffing for us! What’s a dog to do?

But let’s help the humans face this fearful situation. It’s a little hard for us to sneeze or cough in our elbows, but Wash your paws often.

To all my aunties and uncles in the village and all my other human friends, keep safe and keep up your spirits and look after each other.

Much love from D’artagnan
