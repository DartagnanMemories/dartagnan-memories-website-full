D’artagnan the Guide Dog here ... I had my birthday party on 10 March. Olivia from Homecare Heroes helped my mum Gisele on the day (and took this photo of me).

I received lots of gifts – yummy treats, squeaky toys, apples and pears, a pack of doggie ice-blocks, a St Francis of Assisi medal and contributions to my taxi fund (yes, I have one so my mum and I can catch a taxi when I’m too tired to walk or when it’s too hot or wet). Finola baked and decorated 24 delicious cupcakes and delivered them in the morning. Everyone sang “Happy Birthday” to me, and young guest Owen helped me blow out my number 8 candle.

Thank you to everyone who came or sent their good wishes, and especially to those who pitched in with the cleaning up, and to those who also gave chocolates and other goodies to my mum!
