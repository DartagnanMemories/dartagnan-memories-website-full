D’artagnan the guide dog here.  These days many people comment on my grey whiskers. Yes, at 11 and a ½ dog years, according to modern canine gerontology  I am now 70-something.
So as  an ageing  working guide dog I have to undergo six-monthly reviews: the equivalent of the human driver’s license renewal test.
I just had mine:   and I blew it.  But let me tell you the sorry story:
The trainer from the Guide Dogs school turned up at 10 am, just as I had settled in my outside bed for my morning nap. 
He said to my mum, “let’s go”.
I recognised the trainer: it was the same bloke who back in April made me go through that long review test: walk to Ashfield Station. Get  on the train. Get off at Central and walk to the country trains and do train boarding exercises. Then a train to town Hall and make our way to the WEA  in Bathurst ST – then the whole route in reverse.   
No way was I doing that  today, I thought.
Mum said, “C’mon Booboo, time to go for your review”.
I Cramped on to my bed like a magnet to a fridge door. 
Mum dragged me off and put my harness on to me as I wriggled and wriggled.
Then we set off under the watchful eye of the trainer.
Up the steps and into the parking bay   …I walked like a drunk dog. I even walked mum into a bush.   
Into Seaview St, I sniffed the hedge and wall all the way, though I know sniffing is a big no-no when I am on the job.
Then I did that stalling thing of cramping my paws to the footpath and mum had to push and pull to get me to move forward a few steps. Then I did it again and again.
The trainer faced us and said: “Is this usual?”
Mum said “NO!”
The trainer asked in a disbelieving tone; “No?”
Mum repeated : “No”.
I bowed my head down and murmured” “No”
Then the trainer took us into the Heritage Gardens and he and mum had a talk while I  laid on the grass, not daring to look-up at mum and ask her if she had any treats in her bag.
I won’t relay the whole long conversation but the short of it is that I am now on light duties only (after mum persuaded the trainer that what he had witnessed was not ‘usual” and there was no need to confiscate my harness license there and then).
But the plan is that I will hang up my harness at the end of the year.  Mum will need to go through a refresher course in using her white cane  as a mobility aid.
Mum had already hinted it was her plan for me to retire on my 12th birthday in March next year or before if needs be.  And during lockdown we only went for local walks and lots of visits to the park where I roam free and swim and play with other dogs. We have been going to most of our destinations by car. And we seldom do much work during the hot summer months.
Mum and I will ease into my retirement gradually and after I hang up my harness I will stay with mum a little while   as a regular dog.  But when a new guide dog is found for mum, I will go live somewhere else.
I didn’t mean to put on such a performance for my review and I didn’t know that the plan was only to walk around the block. 
A few days later I stopped mum walking into the flooded   end of Seaview St and on another day I stopped mum when a big truck blocked our way: and I was not even in harness those 2 times.   
So please know everyone that I am still alert and able to keep mum safe and will keep doing so even after I hang up my harness.
But if you can assist mum and me to get around or mind me when mum is doing cane training or can’t take me with her during this  period, please email mum on giselemesnage@bigpond.com or call mum on 9799 5388.
Thank you everyone in my village home.
