Alice is a honey of a girl dog who lives in the area with her mum Jo, who is the sister of Jenny, one of the residents here. 
And Alice and I have a new bed!

Ha-ha! Got you! I mean we each have a new bed: separate beds in separate houses. 

Jo took my mum to a pet store to buy me a new bed, and Jo bought a new bed for Alice too.

But when we sniffed our new beds they didn’t smell right. So Alice and I put on a bit of an act and refused to sleep on our new beds.
So Jo and my mum had this daily email chat about what to do, while Alice and I kept up our protest.

Robyn, another one of mum’s friends took up our cause and demanded that our mums should inspect our beds and make sure     there wasn’t a pea under the mattress.  

As if Alice and I would have let a pea go uneaten!

Then Alice tried her new bed and liked it and called me a sook for wanting to sleep on my mum’s bed.  

Well that did it.  So I gingerly tried my new bed and…it was really quite cosy.

Jo and my mum put our favourite blanket on top of our beds and now they smell just right.

Good night Alice…Good night D’artagnan.
