D’artagnan the guide dog here. As my good readers know, I will be hanging-up my guide dog harness at the end of the year. So, my mum has had to get refresher lessons in using her white cane as a mobility aid. Well actually my mum has canes of different colours :a yellow one and an orange one and also a purple one she uses for evening outings when she gets dressed-up and wants to accessorise.

Did you know that guide dog handlers like my mum call their cane “my skinny dog”? ROLF!

So, for my column this month I thought I’d share my thoughts about my mum’s skinny dog.

Every Monday morning, Sue, the lady from the Guide Dogs NSW/ACT organisation who is giving my mum refresher training with her skinny dog comes to our kennels in Seaview Heights and I watch Sue and mum go off out Gate 5 and along Seaview St. I stay home with one of my auntie-minders: Jenny or Janet or Sheena or Aileen or Rae or Noreen or Pam…and when mum comes home I hear all the stories about that dumb skinny dog.

Mum walks more slowly with her dumb skinny dog. And the dumb skinny dog cannot walk in a straight line and makes mum veer off-track into driveways and mum has to bang that dumb skinny dog’s head into the wall to find her way.

And my good readers know how I keep mum safe when cars or big trucks pull out of driveways or when we cross a road. I stop and tell mum, “wait.” But dumb skinny dog just keeps on walking on with mum tagging along. And Mum has to tap its dumb head onto the warning tactile tiles on the footpath to make sure it doesn’t run across the road into oncoming traffic And same tap-tap-tap when there are steps or other drops. Really, what do they teach these skinny dogs at training school?

And as for finding places! If mum tells me find this place or that place, I take mum to that place. Okay, I do at times lead mum to the butcher when she says, “find the bank,” but I do get it right 99% of the times. I know there cannot be too much of a brain in that little head at the tip of the stick, but the dumb skinny dog is brain dead when it comes to memorising places and leading mum to the doctor’s or the office or anywhere!

No wonder that the dumb skinny dog only cost $50 -and I go for $50,000 (well, maybe not now that I am going grey and making old bones).

 And I guess a plus is that skinny dog doesn’t need to eat and I like my mushroom and kefir, apples and yoghurt, Brussel sprouts and spinach, sardines and salmon and chicken and my mandarins, etc. etc. etc.
Anyway, when mum comes home after training each Monday she gives me a cuddle and tells me I’m a good boy and she sticks her skinny dog behind the chair, and it stays there until the next lesson. And then in the week mum and I go to the park and I run around. And at night I sleep on mum’s bed. And I think of dumb skinny dog no more.
