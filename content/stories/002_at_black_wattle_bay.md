D’artagnan the guide dog here.

Each day I have to concentrate hard on my job when I am guiding my mum, so I love it when I have a chance to go for a free run. One of my favourite places to unwind is Black Wattle Bay.   As soon as mum takes off my harness and leash, I am off like a rocket! It’s such a wonderful feeling running free in the fresh air along the shore of the harbour . At a few spots, I go into the water and have a paddle.  It cools me down on hot days but on colder days, I just dip my 2 front paws into the water and then I’m out of there pretty quick. It’s fascinating to stare at all the fish and other wriggly  species in the water. I love all those fishy smells , especially the oyster shells and the seaweeds.  There is a patch of grass there that I always stop to nibble: I am not sure what sort of grass it is but I can’t stop eating it! It’s fun also saying hello to all the other dogs there.  There is a French café there called Antoine’s.  When I dash inside and go into the kitchen, they call out ‘Bonjour D’artagnan’, and they give me a little madeleine   tea cake.  

When we come home, I get hosed down and then I have a sleep, tired from all that running around and swimming and all the fun.
