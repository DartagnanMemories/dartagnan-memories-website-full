D’artagnan the guide dog here.

In March this year I celebrated my 11th birthday.

Guide dogs usually retire when they are aged around 10. So, since I turned 10 I have been on six-monthly performance reviews and vet reviews, which go towards assessing when I need to chuck-in my harness.
I passed my vet review, and in April a guide dog instructor came to observe me working. Mum had just signed-up to do a course at the WEA community college in the city, the first time in 18 months that we were going physically there, rather than doing courses online. And we also had not caught the train to the city in a long time.

So, the instructor tagged along with us for the walk from our place to Ashfield Station and then we hopped on a train and went to Central. At Central we did a bit of practice work getting on and off a stationary train. Then we hopped on another train to Town Hall. Now at Town Hall I had to pull mum when the instructor was telling her to go straight. And I said, “NO, left”. Mum followed me. Then it was up the steps and right into Bathurst St, across Kent St and then through a side door at the WEA. Again, the instructor stopped mum and said , “NO, a bit further”. And I stood there and insisted , “ This way”. Of course, I was right, again.

Then after that we walked back to Town Hall, and mum and I always go back a different way. So again, instructor called out “NO”. And I just stood there and let mum explain to him that I was right, again.
Then we got back to Ashfield and walked home.

The instructor said, “I’m so impressed”. Apparently, he had been thinking that this old dog would not even remember the way to the WEA, let alone get mum there safely on the train and across busy city streets, and last the morning’s work.

I showed him!

Of course, as soon as he had marked my performance review off with a big tick, and he had left our place, I flopped on the sofa and rested my weary bones and head.

Oh gosh, that’s done for another six months, I thought.

Mum told the instructor that her plan is that I will start winding down my work at the end of the year, enjoy the Summer in semi-retirement because we seldom go out in the hot Summer months, and that I will officially retire on or before my 12th birthday in March next year.

And so, my brilliant career as a guide dog will come to an end. I will have to go and live somewhere else, because when a new dog comes to replace me, there will not be enough space for us all in mum’s small unit. Mum doesn’t like to think about that day, and me neither.
