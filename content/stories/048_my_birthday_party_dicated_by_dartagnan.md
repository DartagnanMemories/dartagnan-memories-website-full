D’artagnan the (retired) guide dog here.

What a wonderful birthday/retirement party I had on Sunday 20 March!

The weather was amazing after all the rain, and it was so nice to be able to gather on the Village Green and enjoy the sunshine.

So, a little bit of a round-up…

There were around 65-70 guests at the party, ranging in age from 4 to 98.

And many pooch friends to!

I received 30 apologies from friends who could not come, and messages from around Australia , including Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth, and even from Finland and the UK!

I also received loving cards and was spoilt with many of my favourite treats and toys.

And my little friend 6-year-old Zoe, whom I love to bits, even presented me with a special drawing she had drawn just for me!

At the party, there were friends who drove from Ingleburn and even from Milton a 3hour drive away.
And there were old friends whom we had not seen for a few years, and new friend whom we have only recently met.

It was a comfort and a joy to see them all.

Aunty Jenny from the village did a wonderful job MCing the official part of the event, reading messages from friends who could not come.

And we also remembered departed friends and dogs.

Mum also paid tribute to our now retired Guide Dogs instructor and mentor Ray Joyce, who trained mum and me when I was assigned as mum’s guide dog in 2011. I wrote about Uncle Ray in one of my columns entitled “The exemplary life of a guide dog trainer.”

Then the roaming microphone was passed around to the attendees who wanted to say a few words.
I blushed at all their stories of my alleged antics!

What? Did I really do that? Uh, Maybe I , uh, possibly, I may have perhaps strayed just a little from the official guide dog rules book on occasion!

It warmed my little heart however, that my good friends also remembered how I guided mum safely across roads and on train and around obstacles and dangers everywhere we went during the more than 10 years I was on the job.

And how I educated university students and others about the role guide dogs play.
Oh, and I cannot forget to mention the glorious food at the party!

But would you believe it my good readers that mum made an announcement on the microphone, asking the guests not to feed me?

All mum allowed me was a small square of the birthday cake, a cup cake and an exploded little boy sausage.

(Pssst…please don’t tell mum about the other morsels I managed to score!)

Anyway, as the day closed they lit a number 1 and number 2 candles to show I was 12 and everyone sung happy birthday and I felt loved and special.

It was all filmed for a series on the life of guide dogs from puppyhood to retirement that is now under production.

So, stay tuned!
