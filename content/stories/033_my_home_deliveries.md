D’artagnan the guide dog here.

As a dog of the digital age, I shop online.

So, when the parcel post comes, It’s usually for ‘moi’.

There’s my natural Greek yogurt make-it-at -home delivery; my hard biscuits; all my canine medications; my toys; my guide dog and dog-about-town accessories; my Aloe Vera shampoos and conditioners and other toiletries ;and other essentials. Oh yes, mustn’t forget the box of 10 rolls of x 200 poo bags: yes, that’s 2,000 poo bags.

Aunty Jenny picks up my parcels from the office and delivers them to my door.

And then there is my regular Coles deliveries. some of that is for mum, but for me there are apples; frozen Brussel sprouts; frozen spinach; tinned sardines , salmon and tuna; chicken nuggets; Dentastix and treats; mandarins, strawberries and watermelon (to share with mum); and raspberry dark chocolate . OH, wait a minute: I think that one is for mum. That’s okay, I’ll pretty much get a taste of everything in that order.
 I always supervise the delivery man. Sometimes they say, “nothing for you here, mate’. And I stare back and say, “Phooey. It’s mostly for me’.

The other day Aunty Jenny brought over this parcel and said, “A new collar for you Mr D’. I thought, ‘Yay!’. Imagine my stupefaction when it turned out to be an extended girth strap for my harness. Mum ordered it for me because, splutter, I, allegedly, had put on a little weight around my midriff. Oh, the ignominy !
Let’s see what’s on e-bay. Hmmm, an extended belt for mum. Okay, add to basket and go to checkout.
