D’artagnan the guide dog here. This month I thought I would go retro and share some past stories of my escapades. 
#1: Mum had to go to a big-do in the city.  She gave me my dinner and then got dressed and called a taxi.  I got out somehow and made for a patch of grass where I had sniffed some pretty appetising blood and bone garden mix.  Mum and a few neighbours were calling my name, but I was in ignore-mode.  Then mum called out, “Dinner’.  I stupidly thought, ’Wow, a second helping?’. So, I galloped home, my little collar bell jingling. Mum grabbed me, put my harness on, and pushed me in the waiting taxi, while Aunty Carmel  was saying ‘Naughty boy’, naughty boy’.
#2: Mum was waiting for a friend to go out for coffee.  I got out and went to visit the construction workers on the other side of the village, because those guys always have food.  They caught me and gave me…a bowl of water! Meanwhile, mum had raised the alarm and sent out a search party. Then mum’s friend turned up and came looking for me, and the construction workers handed me over.  We went for coffee. When mum came home, there   were lots of messages on her phone: the ladies at the office thought that mum’s friend had kidnapped me.
#3: We were at Trinity Grammar for my exercise around the oval.  Young John who usually looked after me was away, so his dad Tom had come.  Mum and Tom were talking, and I went for a wander. When they could not find me, they called the police,  who put an APB out: ‘all cars in the Ashfield area be on the lookout for a black guide dog answering to the name of D’artagnan’.  I am not joking! It was a freezing July morning, 6 am, and I was with the maintenance workers on the school grounds, who  were having a hot breakfast in their warm cabin.
There are more…ask my mum!
