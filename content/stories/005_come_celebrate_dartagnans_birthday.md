D’artagnan the(retired) guide dog here.

I came to live in this village with mum in September 2011, when I was just 18 months old, having graduated early from guide dog school and having topped my class!

Fast forward to 2022, and I will turn 12 this 10 March and I have now hanged up my harness.

I have had many adventures along the way, here and in the wider world, some of these stories I have shared in my column each month.

Ah my good readers, do you remember when I flipped on my back into the belly rub position in full harness at the bank in Summer Hill, because I got fed up with mum and I waiting in line? Or when I made a little pig out of myself at Fin’s pizza night? Or when I tried to swallow a whole avocado, or when I ate the 24 arancini rice balls mum was taking to a party? The vet said I was “a legend” when mum told him what I had done LOL! The vet didn’t laugh however when I picked up a discarded piece of chicken, got a chicken bone injury, and mum had to recruit neighbours Mma Carmel Wall and Mma Eileen O’Mullane from the number 2. Ladies’ detective agency to check my poos for blood. And what about when I had to step over Aunty Pam who had fallen, so I could get to the hot chips she had dropped on the ground? And when I got stuck between the two front seats of a car during a visit to Perth and we held up 5pm traffic coming out of a parking lot? Yes, I went on a plane to Perth and a train to Melbourne and stayed in nice hotels with beds with fluffy doonas and room service!

And then there were all my escapades, which filled up two months’ worth of my column in the Grapevine!

Ah and I have had many fund days at Sydney Park and other parks ; attended classes at the WEA on Shakespeare and on philosophy and mathematics and so many other interesting subjects; went to many plays at the Ensemble Theatre and oh what grand nights I had at the Opera in the Domain, and I even met the conductor of the orchestra, Brian Castles-Onion, who came over to where we were sitting especially to say hello to moi!

I will miss that life and this village and all my friends here when I have to go live somewhere else. The Guide Dogs organisation is still looking for some lovely people to adopt me when a new dog is matched to my mum.

That will be a sad day, but for now I would love you to come to celebrate my 12th birthday and my retirement. Everyone is invited but please let my mum know if you plan on coming so we can get in touch with you if plans change.

When: Sunday 20 March at 3 pm.
