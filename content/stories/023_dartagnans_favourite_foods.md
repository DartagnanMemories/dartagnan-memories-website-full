People often ask my mum, “What do you feed D’artagnan?”

So this month I thought I would talk about my favourite foods.

For breakfast I usually have natural yoghurt and a cut-up apple or pear.

Mum doesn’t feed me lunch so I just scrounge some of hers. My number 1 choice is smoked salmon, but I’m happy with tandoori chicken or tuna in olive oil. I’m not fussy.

Dinner is usually sardines or salmon (human grade, none of that pet food variety) and Brussel sprouts or spinach. Sometimes mum makes mince or chicken or fresh fish. I always come and say “thanks mum.”

I also love it when mum makes soup, and I get a big bowl. Warms up my tummy!

When we go to Summer Hill, I take mum to the fast food bar for barbeque chicken or fish and hot chips: I let mum choose.

And then we go to the fruit shop and mum buys a big tub of fruit salad to share with me,no grapes. Grapes are on the no-no list for dogs, there with chocolate (as if chocolate was good for humans!)

For my supper at night, I get warm milk and a hard biscuit.

On Sunday we usually go to Yeo Park or the Cook’s River and mum brings a picnic and then we come home and share an ice cream – I like the honeycomb ones.

Oh and I can’t fail to mention that I have an addiction to mandarins. I have even earned the nickname, “Mandarin boy”!
