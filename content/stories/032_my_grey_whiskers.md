D’artagnan the guide dog here.  
I was only 18 months old when I first came to live with mum at the village. 
I celebrated my second birthday here in 2012, and every birthday since then -  except last year in 2020 when mum cancelled my special 10th birthday party because of that COVID pandemic thing.
On 10 March 2021 I will be turning 11, and I was looking forward to another party, but mum is hesitant about making plans because there are still some restrictions in effect in the village.
What a shame. I enjoyed all my birthday parties over the years, celebrating with the neighbours, friends and the volunteers who take me out for free runs.  
And of course, all the party goodies!
And I loved it when people sang “Happy birthday D’artagnan “ and cheered and clapped for me!
But the thing I don’t like much is that on the occasion of each birthday, apparently I got a year older! I was thinking that because I didn’t have a birthday party last year and now looks like the same for this year, this means I didn’t get older.
So why are so many people saying I have grey whiskers!
And I hear mothers telling their children, “Look at the old dog”.
I turn my head around looking for the old dog, and then I realise I’m the only dog walking in the street.  Phooey!!
And I hear people asking mum when  am I going to retire.
Retire? Excuse me, there are still a lot of miles left in this old dog, even if it takes me a little longer now to walk those miles! 
I still eat all my food; I am  “regular”; I still enjoy a run and a swim;  I can still jump on mum’s bed and on the sofa; and I can still remember all the places mum asks me to find when I’m on the job and we walk to Ashfield or Summer Hill.
I passed the vet review and also the Guide Dogs review, and so I should be good to work at lease for another six months.
So next time you see me walking around with mum, please don’t point to my grey whiskers!
And if mum cannot arrange a birthday party for me in March, please drop in for a cup of tea around 10 March and sing to me , “Happy birthday young D’artagnan”.
