D’artagnan the (retired) guide dog here.

Now that I am retired, I have a lot of time on my paws to think about the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Deep Thought, the supercomputer in the Hitchhikers Guide to the galaxy, said the answer was 42.

Well as it happens, 42 is the number of teeth an adult dog has in its mouth.

That got me thinking it would be fun to share some dog trivia facts with my good readers this month.

Did you know?
- A Russian dog named Laika was the first animal in space and travelled around the Earth in 1957.
- Dogs poop in alignment with Earth’s magnetic field and choose to do so in a north-south axis.
- Dogs can learn more than 1,000 words.
- Dogs use their whiskers as sensing devices.
- A dog’s sense of smell is 10,000 times stronger than that of a human.
- Dogs sweat through their paws.
- There are over 360 breeds of dogs worldwide
- The Irish Wolfhound is the largest breed of dogs
- Dogs have three eyelids
- Dogs do not have an appendix
- A greyhound would beat a cheetah in a long-distance race
- Dogs can be left or right pawed.

And you can bedazzle all your friends with this one…

- Australian dogs poo the weight of the Sydney Harbour Bridge each month. Animal Medicine Australia estimates there are 5.1m dogs in Australia. A single dog produces approximately 340 grams of waste per day. That means Australia’s dogs drop a mind-boggling weight in poo, 1734 tonnes – equivalent to nine empty jumbo jets every day, or a Sydney Harbour Bridge’s worth monthly!

Based on the above trivia fact, I have contributed over 1,200kg of poo to the local surrounds of the village since I came to lived here in September 2011! If mum had not picked it all up, I could have donated it to the efforts to restore the Sydney Harbour Bridge on its 90th birthday this March 2022!
