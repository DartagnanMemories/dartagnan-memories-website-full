This website is a place to remember and celebrate my late guide dog D’artagnan.

D’artagnan was born on 10 March 2010. All the puppies in a guide dogs breeding program litter are traditionally given names starting with the same letter of the alphabet. He was from a “J” litter, and he was named “Jester.”

I renamed him D’artagnan when he came to live with me on 10 September 2011, when he was just 18-months old, having graduated early and topped his guide dog training class.

D’artagnan went to the [Rainbow Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Bridge_(pets)) on 29 March 2022, just nine days after a wonderful gathering to celebrate his 12th birthday and retirement, attended by 70 of his human friends and many canine friends too.

The years in-between were filled with many adventures.

D’artagnan had the character traits of both a [jester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester) and his namesake, the real musketeer [Count d’Artagnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Batz_de_Castelmore_d%27Artagnan) - mischievous, dashing, loyal, wise and noble.

D’artagnan was an ace guide dog: he was my eyes and compass as he and I moved as one in all our journeys for over 10 years.

D’artagnan was an endearing character who won the heart of all the people we met in that decade.

D’artagnan was a soulmate who gave me companionship and comfort around the clock.

My heartfelt thanks to [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) for creating this [www.dartagnanmemories.org](http://www.dartagnanmemories.org) website for D’artagnan.

Working on this project has lifted my spirits as I grieve for the loss of D’artagnan.

Beyond this, the website will provide an outlet for me to talk about D’artagnan in my own voice, with humour, fondness, and dignity.

It will also be a repository for the stories as told by D’artagnan about his life as a guide dog.

And it will also be a place where D’artagnan’s friends can share their recollections, photos and tributes.

As an example of the anecdotes that will fill this website, I share here a dream I had just before writing this message to the visitors to the [www.dartagnanmemories.org](http://www.dartagnanmemories.org) website.

During a day nap, I dreamed that D’artagnan was back with me, alive and running happily around my home. I felt his body to make sure he was real. Every sensation told me it was him, in the flesh.

Then I said to him: “Oh D’artagnan, you have a tribute website now. Uh, if you are here, what am I going to tell people”?

Then I woke up. Although I was sad at the realisation the apparition was not real, I laughed that this awkward dilemma had just been a dream. But it was, indeed, hauntingly evocative of D’artagnan’s Jester character, reaching out from the afterlife to let me know he is still with me, in the spiritual sense.

For many months as D’artagnan moved towards his retirement, I anguished over the question of his future.

Now, this question has in a sense been resolved. In the hybrid world of the new normal, D’artagnan will now live in the virtual world of this website, where I can visit him each day and commune with him by just typing [www.dartagnanmemories.org](http://www.dartagnanmemories.org).

This gift of this tribute website from [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) is a true treasure.

Thank you [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) team and all friends who will participate in creating this beautiful D’artagnan Memories tribute website.
