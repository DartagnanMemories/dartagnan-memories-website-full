The dog of distinction

Has left this life!

And with it he has taken his uniqueness and light.

His love and relish for living, and devotion to Gisele has endeared him to all who know him well.

He was clever and kind as he guided his mistress and reliably managed to avoid any distress.

He was waggly and kind and never annoyed

— the most benign disposition he expressed and enjoyed.

His beautiful coat, all shining and black jet was fed with sardines, spinach, chicken soup and yet he always, charmingly, asked for more — and then foraged old scraps, squashed pie and kids' picnics, galore.

He and Gisele flew in planes, travelled the trains and strolled the street, and pollies, CEOs, celebs, hoy polloi, and us, they would meet.

They were united, together, shared life, as one, forever enjoying each adventure — such fun.

D'Artagnan is his name — a dog of renown whose passing is felt all over town.

Vale D'Artagnan, grand dog musketeer,

whose class and distinction was without peer.
