title: 'Why did you choose that name?'

I liked the name and the story. And at the time I was told a new guide dog had been matched to me, I was coming across a lot of mentions of d’Artagnan and the Three Musketeers. Some people thought the name was too long or too hard to say. So, he also became Mr D for short. Also, d’Artagnan (small d and cap A) means from Artagnan, a place in Gascony in South-Western France. I changed the spelling to D’artagnan (cap D and small a) to personalise the name as his given name.
