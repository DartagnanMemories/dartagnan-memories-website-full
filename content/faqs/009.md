title: 'Can you choose the sex or colour of the dog?'

Well, yes, sort of. When you are assessed for a new dog, you can say your preferences.  But you don’t always get what you ask for! Before D’artagnan, my previous guide dog, Katie, was a golden female Labrador.  I still had a lot of her pretty things when I was assessed for a new dog back in 2010, so I asked for another golden female Labrador. And I was matched with D’artagnan  (then Jester),  a black male Labrador!  I did not indicate any preferences this time.  I’ll wait and see.
