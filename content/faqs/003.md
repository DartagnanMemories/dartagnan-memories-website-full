title: 'How did D’artagnan get his name?'
---
I named him after the legendary French historical personage, Charles de Batz de Castelmore d'Artagnan, also known as Count D’artagnan, who features in the novel by Alexander Dumas, “The Three Musketeers”. The characters of the three musketeers in the novel - Athos, Porthos, and Aramis- were fictional, but d’Artagnan was real (1611-1673), although exploits in the novel and the other d’Artagnan Romances were fictionalised.
