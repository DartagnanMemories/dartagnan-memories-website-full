Welcome everyone to the D’artagnan Memories tribute website.

My guide dog D’artagnan was born on 10 March 2010. His litter name was Jester.

I renamed him D’artagnan when he came to live with me on 10 September 2011, when he was just 18-months old, having graduated early and topped his guide dog training class.

D’artagnan went to the [Rainbow Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Bridge_(pets)) on 29 March 2022, just nine days after a wonderful gathering to celebrate his 12th birthday and retirement, held on 20 March 2022, attended by 70 of his human friends and many canine friends too.

The years in-between were filled with many adventures.

D’artagnan had the character traits of both a [jester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jester) and his namesake, the real musketeer [Count d’Artagnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Batz_de_Castelmore_d%27Artagnan) - mischievous, dashing, loyal, wise and noble.

My heartfelt thanks to [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) for creating this [www.dartagnanmemories.org](http://www.dartagnanmemories.org) website for D’artagnan.

Working on this project has lifted my spirits as I grieve for the loss of D’artagnan.

Beyond this, the website will provide an outlet for me to talk about D’artagnan in my own voice, with humour, fondness, and dignity.

It will also be a repository for the stories as told by D’artagnan about his life as a guide dog.

And it will also be a place where D’artagnan’s friends can share their recollections, photos and tributes.

This gift of this tribute website from [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) is a true treasure.

Thank you [Intopia](https://intopia.digital/) team and all friends who will participate in creating this beautiful D’artagnan Memories tribute website.

**With love from Gisele and D’artagnan**
