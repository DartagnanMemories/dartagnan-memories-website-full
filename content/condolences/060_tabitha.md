I am so sad to hear the news about D'artagnan. 

I shed a few tears when I heard your voicemail message, it's so awful when we lose our beloved pets. I hope he passed peacefully. I am sure he knew how very loved he was in his last days. I am thankful that I was able to be one of D'artagnan's friends. Sending you lots of hugs for Perth.
