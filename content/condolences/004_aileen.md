I feel very sad after hearing about D’artagnan, I know what he meant to you.  I understand your heart is breaking and I don’t know how to help. 

Thinking of you, and hope life is not too difficult for you. You’ll never forget him, Just hoping it will become easier. 

So glad he went peacefully. Grieving is tough.
