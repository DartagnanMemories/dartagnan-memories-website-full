I am thinking of you so much and sending all my love and compassion.  I cannot imagine how lost and lonely you must feel without your beloved D’artagnan.  Life seems so unfair at times.  I hope you are allowing yourself time to grieve this terrible loss (and I hope that doesn’t sound like a platitude – while our situations are totally different, I know for me, the loss of my Mum comes over in waves with some days harder than others).  I can only imagine the enormity of your grief and loss.
