It is so sad to hear that beloved D’artagnan has passed away. I totally understand that how losing such a lovely and loyal companion is difficult for you. I also totally understand that missing a great guide dog after all the years is a big loss. So please accept my condolences as my thought is with you. 

I will definitely look at the website dedicated for D’artagnan and will email you my recalls.
