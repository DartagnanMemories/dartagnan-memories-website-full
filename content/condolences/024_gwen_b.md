My dear friend Gisele 

Words are very difficult to suitably express my sadness at the loss of D’artagnan. 

Your companion and guide for so many years was such a large part of your life and that of all your friends, both at the Village and wherever you went. 

Please accept my  sincere sympathy and I will remember you and your friend in my prayers.
