oh Gisele.  I'm so sorry for your loss of D'artagnan.  Please accept my condolences.  I'm so glad you got the birthday celebration and now the memories page. It looks great and D'artagnan looks dapper in his purple bow tie!

Life works in strange ways.  He retired from working with  great patner and advocate, had this great celebration, and maybe then decided his life was complete. 

I'll look to see if I have any pictures and think about if I have a story to share.  

Thanks for letting me know the news.
