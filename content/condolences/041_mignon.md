I am so sorry to hear about D’Artagnan. You were very brave to make the decision for him and to let him go peacefully.   

Now he won’t have to try and fit in to a new owner, which would have been very confusing for him, I think.  

Having had this same experience many times during my life, I know how sad you must be without him.  It’s such a hard thing to endure but you did the right thing for him.  He was a wonderful dog and he will long be remembered by the people who loved him.  

So glad to have been at his birthday party. He had a happy day as did we all.
