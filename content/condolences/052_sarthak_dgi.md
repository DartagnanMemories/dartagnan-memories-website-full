Few people have the same relationship with their pets as Gisele had with D’artagnan. I am sure everyone reading this knows just how quickly pets become part of the family – joyous memories, laughter, frustration, all centred around these small bundles of life. There is a certain warmth and comfort that pets emanate, provided to us unconditionally. D’artagnan was a cheeky dog but one who expertly guided Gisele and I am sure loved Gisele unconditionally. We will all miss you!
