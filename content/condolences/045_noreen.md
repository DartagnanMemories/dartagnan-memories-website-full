I was so sorry to hear about Mr D. 

I too lost my beloved dog some 7 years ago and I still miss him. 

Of course Mr D was not only your wonderful companion but your extra eyes as well. 

I will certainly miss his lively, interesting and amusing jottings each month.  Also seeing him around the village and environs with you.
