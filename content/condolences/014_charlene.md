I want to send my deepest condolences to you. I know how much D’artagnan meant to you. The thing you said about him "being your eyes" really struck a chord with me because I realised how much of him was actually part of you.  

I meant every word I said in that speech. And don’t forget how much you have achieved with having a guide dog for all of those years and for accomplishing so much with him. 

I’m glad I got the chance to say a final goodbye to D’artagnan at his party.
