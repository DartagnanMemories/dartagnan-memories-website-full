Such very sad news, D’artagnan was a lovely dog & yes he did guide you safely for many years. 

It would have been a very difficult decision for you to make.  

D’artagnan is probably happily running around in doggy heaven. 

I’ve been in hospital & not seen Buddy for nearly two months & I miss my little fur baby but his being spoiled at one of children’s home. 
Please stay safe & we will catch up soon.
