I am so really, really sorry to hear the news.  You must be so very sad.  

Phil and I had a gorgeous little rescue dog called Trina and we were devastated when we had to let her go. I was only glad that we were able to save her from further suffering.  Dogs, and pets in general, and particularly D'artagnan, play such an enormous and wonderful part of our lives, that often it is more painful than losing a human member of the family.  

How wonderful that you were able to give D'artagnan such an amazing birthday and retirement party and I am very honoured that I was able to be there.  There will be so many sad people in the Village and all who knew D'artagnan - he is part of the history of the Village - you could say one of its characters!!

Take care
