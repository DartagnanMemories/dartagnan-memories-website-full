We were greatly saddened to hear of the passing of our beautiful boy! I am so sad for him and for you. It is such a traumatic thing to go through. Still we are so proud to have raised such a fine guide dog and companion ( though to be fair it was really all him). We are also extremely grateful to you for looking after him so well, ensuring that he was well walked, well vet checked and spoilt - but in a good way!
