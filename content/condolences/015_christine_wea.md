I would like to respond on all our behalves. 

You will be feeling bereft and lonely without your stalwart friend and companion and I offer you our warmest condolences.  

Many, many years ago on tv there used to be an advertisement that had a tune in it with the accompanying words: “dogs don’t think they are dogs, they think they are four-legged people”. I’ve never forgotten that because I think it is true. 

Our pets loves us unconditionally and the mighty D’artagnan was the most loving and sweet fellow and you were blessed to have him and he was blessed to have you and that will no doubt cause you to shed a tear but also cause you to smile in pride and joy. 

God bless him and God bless you.
