So sad to know D’artagnan passed away…. 

There were lots beautiful memories of D’artagnan. 

But glad to see you launch the meaningful activities for international guide dog. 

And glad to see your life back to normal. 

You have been an amazing mum to D’artagnan. He had a great life with a mum who loved him and cared for him so much. May he rest in peace.  

Take care
