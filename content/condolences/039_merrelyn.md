I'm so sorry for your loss of beautiful D’artagnan.

I first met you and your lovely boy near the Cooks River where I live. 

You were uncertain as to where you were.

So I spent some time with you. You both liked to sit on the seats at Cup and Saucer Creek near the river.

I often think of you and how much D’artagnan meant to you.
