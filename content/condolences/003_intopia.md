It is with great sadness that I share that D'artagnan has decided to go to the all-you-can-eat buffet in the sky. Unfortunately, D'artagnan had developed a heart condition, and early this week his Mum Gisele had to make the hard decision to put him to sleep forever. We both had a bit of a cry on the phone. D'artagnan always did things on his own terms, and we think he decided that he didn't want to leave his Mum alone and move to a new home, so it was time.

I guess he knew his work here was done.

I hope he is bounding through endless fields of Subway sandwiches and doggy donuts.
