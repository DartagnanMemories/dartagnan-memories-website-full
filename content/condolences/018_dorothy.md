I am so saddened to hear of D’artagnan’s parting. 

So glad that I managed to come to his wonderful and fitting birthday, retirement and , as it turned out, farewell party. What a wonderful day it was with so many people from his life with you sharing the occasion. So glad I got to have so many pats and cuddles. I will always remember the image of him enjoying his birthday cupcake.  He was so wonderful and lucky to be with you for so long. You were a great team.

I am hoping you will have another wonderful companion soon that will capture another part of your heart but never replacing that special spot in your heart for D’artagnan.

Sue has gone to Sydney today for an appointment and I know she will be very very sad too.
