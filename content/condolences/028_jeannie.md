Oh Gisele, that's very sad. Thank you for letting me know.

D'artagnan was a lovely natured dog. It must have been devastating for you to have to make that decision, but it meant he was with you till the end, and he didn't have to go through the trauma of being separated from you.

Some other friends of mine have done some short-term fostering of guide dogs and I had bragged about D'artagnan to them, and they were amazed at how old he was and still working as they said Labradors aren't as long-lived as other breeds and often only live to 12, and usually retire much younger than D'artagnan.

Anyhow, you two were together until the end, and you know he was able to go peacefully, and that was a very humane decision for you to make, heart-breaking as it would have been.  It takes a lot of courage to make such a tough decision, but you have put D'artagnan's welfare as the most important thing, and that is what matters most
