Oh I am so sorry to hear about the passing of Dâ€™artagnan.

How lovely that you were able to celebrate his years of service and enjoy some sunshine with him, as it has been limited recently!

It was such a pleasure having him here and I will miss seeing you both at our matinee sessions.

He was such a wonderful companion for you and I am so sorry for your loss.

Thank you for sharing your news it was lovely to read about his retirement party and I look forward to seeing beautiful memories on the website.
