Please accept my heartfelt condolences. He will leave a big whole in your heart. Maybe a head full 

of fun and joyful memories will make it feel a little better. He has had a long and beautiful life and you would have made the right decision for him, just like he’d made good decisions for you.  

Take care, reach out if you're feeling blue.
