I am so very saddened to hear of the death of dear D’artagnan. You must be devastated by his loss but unfortunately most dogs of his size only survive for about 10 to 12 years so he had a good span for his breed. It is one if the saddest things in life that we humans out live our beloved pets, but the important thing is that we love them and care for them properly while they are alive, and grant them that final act of love, by recognising when the time has come and helping them to a painless and swift end. Such was D’artagnan’s lucky lot and on top if this his life had special, precious meaning because he was your guide and your dear and faithful companion. He was loved and known by so many! How I delight in my memories of him coming with you to classes at WEA - the whole class loved him and I always think if him when I smell a mandarine! I know you and many others will cherish his memory, and I send you my love at this time - a pivotal moment for your life. I hope that your next guide dog will settle in well - D’artagnan will be a hard act to follow, but a young dog will bring vital assistance and new joy to you. Let me know how things progress - it is lovely to hear from you despite the sad news, and I hope we keep in touch and I will get to meet your new canine friend soon,
