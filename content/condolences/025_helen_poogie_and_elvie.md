This morning I woke up to read the very very sad news of D'artagnan's death.

It is so upsetting to hear that he is no longer living the special life he had with you, Gisele and his many friends at the village.

Dart was a special dog in your life and the devotion and guidance he gave you throughout will be so much missed by you.

Human relationship with animals is so close. We love them and they give so much happiness, no matter how or where we are.

The tail wags, hugs and rubs and beguiling looks are unresistable.

I am glad that from a distance, I was allowed into D'artagnan's life. Poogie, Elvie and their carers will be very sad to hear your news.

D'artagnan's amusing stories made us laugh and woof regularly.

How wonderful that our beautiful four paw friend had an exciting retirement party very recently. Lots of people will miss him, but of course, you Gisele will miss him most of all.â€¯
