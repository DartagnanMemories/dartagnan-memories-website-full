Dear Aunty Gisele. I am so sorry to hear the sad news of D'artagnan's passing. 

I had a tear this morning but through the tears I had so many joyful memories ofâ€¯D'artagnan's cheeky personality and his love of cheese - even a whole block. 

I am thinking of you alot today and sending a big big hug and a kiss on each cheek to you. 

Much Love
