Very sorry to hear of the passing of D’artagnan. We lost our family border collie after his 13th birthday earlier this year and were very sad to see him go. It was comforting to know he did have a very happy life though with lots of running after tennis balls, stray food scraps under the table and leftover chips at the beach.

While I only met D’artagnan once on the bridge outside NAB at docklands I could tell he was kind in nature and a very loyal companion. I do know a number of people working at Intopia from my days in the bank, they are fantastic, great to see they could set up a tribute page for you.
