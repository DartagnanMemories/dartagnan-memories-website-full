I'm sorry for your loss.

I was here in Australia when my dog Matisse died. He was quite old - that is, for a dog - but he had accompanied me (and my parents) for quite some time. A good friend, indeed.

I am sure D'Artagnan was a good friend to you too. I am, in fact, quite sad that I did not get, and won't get, to meet him, but if the movie "All dogs go to Heaven" is to be believed, I hope he and Matisse will have a blast up there.

(Matisse preferred bananas to mandarins, so they won't be jealous of each other's food.)
