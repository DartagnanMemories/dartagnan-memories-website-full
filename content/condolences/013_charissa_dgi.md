I am so sorry to hear the news of D’artagnan’s passing. I won’t forget D’artagnan and how he had looked out for you and gave you and many others so much joy. 

I’ll always have fond memories of him and how he had brought joy to you.  

I’d been thinking of him last night and had been looking at past albums on my phone for photos of him and Gisele to remember him by. 

A big bear hug to you Gisele, virtual for now, but I’ll try to visit one weekend.
