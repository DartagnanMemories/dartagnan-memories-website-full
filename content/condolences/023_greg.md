It’s lovely to hear from, although less so with this sad news. I’m deeply sorry to hear this and hope you are doing ok. How old was D’artagnan? We lost our little dog last year at the grand age of 18, however even when they are old it doesn’t make it any easier. I certainly can see D’artagnan smiling down at us from somewhere! 

I definitely have many memories of him, mostly involving visits to our Crows Nest office full of great excitement followed by some walks around the block for fresh air and nature calls!
