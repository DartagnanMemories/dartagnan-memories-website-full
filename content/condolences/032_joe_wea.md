Giselle, I understand what a great loss you must be feeling. 2011 – 2022  What a long association!  D’artagnan was indeed a wonderful presence and had a beautiful personality.  I was fortunate to have had him in several classes over the years. 

I send you my condolences, and hope you soon have another companion dog.  I wonder whether he or she will be so fond of mandarins.  I hope I see you again next year.
