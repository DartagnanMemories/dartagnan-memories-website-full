I was very sad to hear that D’artagnan has passed. A beautiful dog, a wonderful companion. I write this while sitting in the vet’s waiting room and hoping that my gorgeous Cheech will be ok. Cats are never the companion that a dog can be but we all love our animals so much and when they pass it is heartbreaking.
