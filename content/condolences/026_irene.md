This afternoon I was saddened to hear of your wonderful guide dog, and good friend D’artagnan’s passing. 

He had a fascinating life with you.  Never a dull moment.  He travelled in buses, trains, and planes. 

You took the best care of him from the day he came to stay with you.   

He was fed the very best of food, which he always enjoyed. He also liked Aunty Pam’s chips. 

He had the very best vet care. 

The boys at Trinity School learned a great deal from D’artagnan. 

You will miss him, but so will so many others living here.
