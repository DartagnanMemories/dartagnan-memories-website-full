Dear Aunty Gisele, 

It was with great sadness that Brooke, Mimi and I learnt of the passing of  D'Artagnan from this world. We shed a few tears and sat around and shared stories of the times we met  D'Artagnan and reminisced on how impressed we were with the amazing depths of his intelligence and how funny he was trying to steal the treats and cheeses off the table at Mum's various morning tea's. 

All our thoughts are with you during these dark times and if there is possibly anything we could do to help you please don't hesitate to give me a call.
