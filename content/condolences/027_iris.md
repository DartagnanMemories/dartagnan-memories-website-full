I heard today that your lovely boy had passed away and I feel so much for you. How wonderful that he was able to enjoy his special day a couple of weeks ago and I am sure he felt the love from all who knew him.

He did not want to leave you to go to another home Gisele. He had the best life partner in you and maybe knew his work was done What a wonderful world it would be if the human race was more like the dog world.
