I am so very sorry to hear this news and it is unexpected given D'Artagnan just had a great celebration and greatly deserved to enjoy his retirement. I wish I could give you a big hug and we could shed tears together. Life is so unfair at times. For what it's worth, you made the right decision to let him go. It is never an easy decision as we are programmed to have hope for recovery even against the odds.â€¯

I will take a look at the site later today. I think this is a great idea - as his birthday demonstrated, D'Artagnan was loved by so so many people. I will dig out those photos of you with him in Canberra giving a speech in Parliament in case we can upload one along with my memories text.
