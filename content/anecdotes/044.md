title: Why can’t you bark like other dogs?

Gisele told me that she had told off D’artagnan the first night he spent at her place and that He had never ever barked after that, even at the park or when other dogs barked in the street.
One day I was taking D’artagnan for a walk and I fell down some steps and could not get up. D’artagnan stared at me as if to say, “What are you doing down there Aunty Pam?”. I could not get up and no-one seemed to hear me calling for help. “Why can’t you bark like other dogs?”, I said to D’artagnan, thinking his bark would surely attract attention. But no, he just stared at me. Finally, some kindly passers-by came to my rescue.
