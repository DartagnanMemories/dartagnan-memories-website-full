title: There’s no other store like…

It was back in those days when the old David Jones catchphrase really was true! Gisele, D'artagnan and I were shopping in the DJs city store. Initially, it was just for a swimming costume for Gisele, but she mentioned, as happens, that since we were already in DJs, perhaps a blouse? and maybe a jumper or a cardigan? We had the undivided attention of a very good senior sales assistant who really knew the stock, and items were arriving in Gisele's changing room cubicle from everywhere. Perhaps we lost track of the time, as clothes shoppers are known to do, and well...shall I say? considerable time passed with little thought of D'artagnan. However, he was undoubtedly aware of the situation and eventually took the opportunity to go it alone and inspect some the other changing rooms, most likely in search of a pee place as it had been a rather long time! Or maybe it was a search for a snack? Anyway, another sales assistant brought his wandering to our attention, and she offered, with great enthusiasm, to take him out for a walk to Hyde Park. Perfect! And so, off D'artagnan happily trotted, escorted by the sales assistant just as if this was a regular everyday David Jones occurrence. But it wasn't, it was most probably the one and only time ever. Way to go D'artagnan!
