title: Where have all the tomatoes gone?

I sometimes order boxes of fresh fruits and vegetables. One week I was happy to find Roma tomatoes in my box. After unpacking everything I went to the garage to put some of the vegies in my spare refrigerator. When I returned, the tomatoes, which I had put on the kitchen bench, were gone. Did tomato-eating aliens from Planet Roma invade my kitchen and beamed the tomatoes to their spaceship? Or did D'artagnan eat them? I'll never never know!
