title: Thanks for the coffee

D’artagnan loved to take taxis and had his own “taxi fund”, started by our neighbour Carmel. But aside from not having to walk and be on the job, he also had worked out that taxi drivers often have cups of coffee at their side , within his reach. More than once he waited until the driver had his eyes on the road and then make his move to lap-up a sip of the coffee. Once we got a taxi from the city and the driver kindly got out to help me in, and D’artagnan took advantage of this moment, and I heard slurp slurp slurp before I could stop him. The driver was friendly and said in a teasing voice , “ Hey, that was special tea home-made by my wife!” On another occasion I had ordered a taxi to pick us up at my place. The driver opened the passenger door and exclaimed, “I know you. You are the dog that stole my coffee last time you were in my taxi!”.
