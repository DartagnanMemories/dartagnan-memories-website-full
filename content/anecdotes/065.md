title: The bum deal

We had just arrived with a friend at one of D’artagnan’s favourite dog parks, Café Bones. D’artagnan was happily running towards the café. Then my friend got a phone call from his wife, who said she needed the car urgently and could he please come home. So, before we even reached the park we had to turn back to the car. “D’artagnan is going to give me the bum treatment”, I joked to my friend. Well, I got in the back seat of the car with D’artagnan. He went to the window, turned around and stuck his bum out at me. My friend turned around in his driver’s seat and just cracked up. “I told you so,” I said.
