The Trinity Grammar school in Sydney had given us access to one of their ovals so D’artagnan could have off-leash exercise. At 6am each week we met a Trinity boy at the school gate, and he would supervise while D’artagnan ran around. This happened for ten years, first with a boy named Mohammed; then a boy named John ; and then a boy named /will. And D’artagnan loved his mornings at Trinity. First he would inspect the cricket pitch , then the grandstand ;and then the trees and finally the length of the fence. He had worked out that these were the spots where the boys had most likely been having food and dropped some morsels on the grass.
