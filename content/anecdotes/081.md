title: Hold the chilli

Aside from his mandarins addiction, D’artagnan also had a fancy for Vietnamese rice paper rolls. We had a bit of a routine whereby we would stop-by the pharmacy next door, and then go to the Vietnamese shop. D’artagnan would literally pull us out of the pharmacy and barge into the shop next door. I like chilli. But chillies are not good for dogs so I would always order 1 box of prawn rice paper rolls with chilli and one without When we “barged in”, the lady serving at the counter would greet us and call out our usual order. I joked with her that I could probably send D’artagnan into the shop with the money attached to his collar and she could just attach the bag with the two boxes of rice paper rolls. I think that little exercise would have worked well enough, but I imagine D’artagnan would have scoffed down all the rolls (with and without chilli) before he even made his way out of the shop!
