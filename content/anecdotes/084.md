D’artagnan’s mandarins addiction has been mentioned in a few stories on his Memories Website. I will share one more here. We were at a rail station that we were not familiar with, so I asked D’artagnan to “find the steps” to the platform He walked very confidently across the concourse and then stopped and sat down. I smelled the whiff of a mandarin, and I didn’t have to see to know what was going on. Someone was sitting on a bench eating a mandarin and D’artagnan was begging. I explained that my dog was mandarin addicted and of course the man offered him the rest of his mandarin. Satisfied, D’artagnan then guided me to the steps that took us to the platform.
