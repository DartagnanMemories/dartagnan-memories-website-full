D’artagnan loved soup Each time I made soup on the stove, D’artagnan would sit at the entrance of the kitchen and watch me cut up all the vegetables and whatever else went into the soup. One day we were walking through Myer Store in Sydney when I felt D’artagnan pulling to the left. I then heard people around me laughing. D’artagnan had his head down into a big soup pot on display in kitchenware. The shiny new pot was quite empty of course.
