title: On the train… it’s all part of the service

We were on a train to Melbourne when there was a delay of several hours due to an incident. Late in the day, a guard came to ask passengers if they would like to order dinner. I declined. But the guard looked at D’artagnan and asked me if the dog may want some food. D’artagnan looked up expectantly. The only thing that seemed okay to give to D’artagnan was a sausage roll, so I ordered this for him. When the guard came back, I asked him how much it was. “Nothing,” he said kindly, “it’s all part of the service”. This kind act got a round of cheers and applause from the tired passengers . The guard then asked me if it was okay for him to feed the sausage roll to D’artagnan . Given his kindness, I said, “yes, that’s okay “. As he was unwrapping the sausage roll and D’artagnan was sitting, waiting, a passenger called out, “Hey, make sure it’s not too hot”. This made everyone laugh.
