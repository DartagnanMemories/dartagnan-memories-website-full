title: Not soy good
author: Ghislaine
---

Gisele and D’artagnan were staying at my place for a few days . It was a bitterly cold night, and we were sitting in my lunge room having a hot drink and snacks by the woodfire. D’artagnan was sitting with us, and I especially remember him lying there patiently with pleading eyes that said, “Leave me some please”.
So, each of us left him a bit of our tea and biscuits but it seemed he was still hungry.
Gisele explained that at home she gave him warm milk at night. I only had soy milk, so I warmed up some and gave him a big bowl. He lapped up about half the bowl and suddenly he raised his head and headed for the door. Gisele guessed he wanted to go out, so she opened the sliding door and headed out into the cold night and D’artagnan threw up. When they came back Gisele said, “I guess he doesn’t like soy milk”. But he had drunk half the bowl before he figured it out!
