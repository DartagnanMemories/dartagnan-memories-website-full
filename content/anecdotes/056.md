title: The garage

Ever since D’artagnan first came to live with me , every time I said, “We are going to the garage”, or mentioned the word “garage” in any way, D’artagnan would do a happy dance and do circles in-between my legs. Once we were walking on the footpath along a busy road and I said, “When we get home, go to the garage first”. And so that set him off, in full harness , diving in-between my legs doing his happy dance, with me trying not to lose my balance. I do not know if it was my French accent when I said that word, or what it was, but he did that same dance every single time. The only time he didn’t do it was just a few days before he passed away . I said, “let’s go to the garage,” but he didn’t react. So, I just walked with him on the lead and repeated “Find the garage,” but he missed the roll-a-door and walked down a side lane, disoriented. It was one of the signs that made me aware that my D’artagnan may not be with me much longer.
