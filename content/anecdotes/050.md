When I took D’artagnan at the local chemist when he first came to live with me, he helped himself to a chocolate bar at the counter while I was busy paying for my purchases. Aside from being worried that chocolate is not good for dogs, I was embarrassed that he had stolen the chocolate bar. But the pharmacist Patrick was most kind and didn’t even charge me for the stolen goods. Patrick however did nickname D’artagnan “the chocolate monster” , and the name stuck for the next 10 years whenever we visited the chemist.
