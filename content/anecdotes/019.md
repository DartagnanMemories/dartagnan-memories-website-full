One freezing July morning at 6am we met my friend Tom at Trinity Grammar so D’artagnan could exercise on the oval. D’artagnan did his usual trick of first checking out the benches along the grandstand for dropped food. Then we realised he was not in the stands or on the oval . After calling his name a few times we went looking for him around the school ground but could not find him anywhere. Tom went to get his car, drove me home and then searched the surrounding streets. Still no sign of D’artagnan , so Tom phoned the police to report him missing., The police put out an APB, “All units in the area, be on the look out for a black Labrador guide dog answering to the name of D’artagnan”. Then at around 7am I got a phone call to let me know D’artagnan was in a workmen’s cabin at Trinity, having a hot breakfast. I am not making this story up, truly. Tom went to get him and brought him home, not a happy dog that his hot breakfast had been interrupted and blissfully unaware of the fuss he had caused . Tom notified the police who cancelled the APB.
