A friend named Sally was due to pick us up at my place to go for coffee at a local café. When Sally came, I noticed D’artagnan had done one of his escapade tricks and was not home. So, we alerted the office, and all my neighbours and Sally also went looking for him. Minutes later Sally returned with D’artagnan, whom she had found visiting the workmen on the site, no doubt looking for an afternoon snack. Off we went to the café. When we returned I learned that the office had phoned my brother fearing that a woman (my friend Sally) had kidnapped D’artagnan and that I was also missing. My wise brother put it all down to one of D’artagnan’s capers and got on with his work .
