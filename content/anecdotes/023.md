D’artagnan loved to go with me to the WEA community college in the city. WE took many courses there on a wide range of subjects: science; philosophy; history of mathematics; chess; literature and so on. Although D’artagnan dozed through some of these classes at times, waking up only for the breaks when we had our snacks and mandarins, I noticed that he always stayed alert and listening whenever we did a class on Shakespeare. He was equally awake when we attended a number of Bell Shakespeare Theatre plays.
