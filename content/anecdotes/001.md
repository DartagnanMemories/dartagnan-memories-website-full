D’artagnan came to live with me on 10 September 2011,aged 18-months. He had just graduated from the guide dog training school at Glossodia, top of his class. My guide dog instructor Ray took us for a practice walk around the block. There are 12 parking bays around the block, and I was adamant that D’artagnan should be able to find his way home before Ray left for the day. I was so impressed when D’artagnan turned into the parking bay for our home with no prompting or hesitation. I said, “Good boy” and I remember thinking, “What a smart dog”.
