I have a talking barcode reader that I use daily to identify groceries, medications and just about anything that has a barcode label. I had to send my device to Melbourne for repair and I was surprised when I received a phone call from the technician, who said , “You have a black guide dog”. “Yes,” I replied, wondering what this had to do with the repair job. “Why? And how did you know?”. “There is a lot of black dog hair in the device, and I think this may have caused the malfunction”.
