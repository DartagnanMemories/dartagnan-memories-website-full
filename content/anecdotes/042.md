I was staying at Gisele’s place for a few days and one night she had to go to visit people and I offered to mind D’artagnan. Gisele showed me a nearby grassy spot where I could take D’artagnan toileting, and she assured me he would lead me back home. A little while after I gave D’artagnan his dinner I thought I would take him walkies and headed for the grass area. The retirement village where Gisele lives is huge and is criss-crossed by a maze of little paths that go in different directions. We headed down one of those paths and took a few turns and found the grass area. D’artagnan did his bizzo and I cleaned up and then said, “Okay, find home”. He spun around and started walking confidently so I tagged along. But it seemed that we were taking an awfully long time to get back to Gisele’s place, and I could not remember taking all those different paths. Finally, D'artagnan stopped in front of a door, but I knew this was not Gisele’s door. I rang the bell and this lovely lady answered and exclaimed “Ah D’artagnan! What a surprise”. Then she looked at me puzzled, and I explained I was Gisele’s friend and that I was lost. It turned out that the lovely lady was Gwen, who had made D’artagnan’s overcoat, and I guess he had just wanted to come say hello. I found out that we were now way on the other side of the village. Gwen thankfully gave me good directions to get back to Gisele’s place.
