It was in the early stages of my training with D’artagnan . It had been raining for a few days and D’artagnan had been refusing to do his number 2’s on the wet grass. I went to a Westfield shopping mall with a friend. It was warm and dry and D’artagnan decided this was a good place to empty his bowels. So, he dumped it right there in the middle of the busy concourse. We cleaned up as best as we could, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. a call came over the PA for a cleaner. Embarrassed by the incident, The next day I phone Ray to tell him what had happened. “Was it caught on camera?” Ray asked. “I think so,” I said. “Why?” , I asked, hoping Ray with his 50 years of dog trainer experience could perhaps give me tips on how to avoid such situations. But is words of wisdom were, “don’t go back there for at least six months”.
