We were walking home from Summer Hill but when we were about to turn into our street, D’artagnan stopped and refused to move forward. He kept looking across the busy road where our friend Adele lives, but this time no-one came to let me know what the problem was. He was getting on in age at that time and I was worried that he may be disorientated . Then D’artagnan did an about turn and started walking back in the direction of Summer Hill, but at the next corner he turned left, and I realised he was going to take us home a different way. We got home safe and then the next day I learned that there were broken branches strewn all over the footpath where we were supposed to have turned into our street…so not only he had avoided the obstacle, but he had worked out a way to get us home safely.
