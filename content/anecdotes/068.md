title: Taxi fund

One of our neighbours Carmel, started a taxi fund for D’artagnan , so to pare him having to walk home when it was too hot or too wet or he was too tired. Over the years, Carmel and other neighbours donated to this fund. It seems D’artagnan was quite aware of this fund. More than once, he pulled me to the taxi stand and sat down waiting expectantly for his ride home. On one such occasion, a taxi driver called out from his cab, “Is the dog coming too?” “Of course,” I replied , and we got in the cab. As an after -thought, I wondered how the driver would have reacted if I had said, “Actually, take the dog home in the cab; I will walk”!
