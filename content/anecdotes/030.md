title: Find a shady spot

On Sundays we often tried to go for a picnic at the Cooks River or at a local park. D’artagnan loved his picnic days and so was always in a hurry to find a spot. But he would get a bit miffed when I would say, “No, not here, ’it’s too sunny. Find a shady spot”. God love him, he understood and would go from one tree to another until I would be satisfied it was shady enough and I would say, “Okay.” Then he would plunk down on the grass and wait for me to open up the picnic bag.
