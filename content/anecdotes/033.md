title: What do I tell the boss?

This story also takes place in the early days of my training with D’artagnan. I wanted to learn how to go to Manly on the ferry. Around that same time The Guide Dogs organisation were writing-up an article on Ray’s 50 years as a guide dog instructor and thought Circular Quay would make a nice backdrop photo shoot for the article. So, a photographer from Guide Dogs’ publicity team tagged along for the training session with Ray and we took photos on the wharf. The ferry came in and Ray suggested to the photographer that she take a couple of photos on the ferry, then get off before departure. So, we all boarded the ferry, and she was happily taking photos, D’artagnan lapping up the attention and the sea air. Then we heard vroom vroom vroom. The photographer packed up her camera, but it was too late… we heard the clunk of the boarding ramp being pulled up .””We’re off”, Ray said. “But I am supposed to be back in the office in 30 minutes,” said the photographer, helplessly. “You won’t make it,” said Ray in his jovial voice. “But what will I tell the boss ?”. Tell him you are on the Manly ferry…”. It was an enjoyable trip to Manly as always, but the poor photographer was too worried to relax and savour the pleasure.
