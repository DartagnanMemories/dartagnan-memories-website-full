At the Café Bones dog park in Sydney, there is a puppy training school. One Sunday we were at the park and D’artagnan was bounding ahead off-leash and off-harness. Then my friend saw him make a bee-line for the puppy training school that was in session. He joined the lines of dogs that were being put through various obedience exercises, doing them all perfectly and getting praise and treats from the trainer. After the class D’artagnan came to re-join us, and the trainer came over to tell us how impressed she was. But she laughed when I showed her his harness and explained that D’artagnan was a fully trained guide dog and he had just been showing off so he could get treats!
