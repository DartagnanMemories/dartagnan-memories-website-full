title: On the job… fallen fence

We were walking around the block early in the morning when D’artagnan stopped. So I put my hand out in front of me and I felt the sharp torn spikes of a fallen wire fence. One more step and I could have crashed into it and cut my face. This time as it was still very early and the traffic was not too heavy, I aske D’artagnan to “Find a way” and we stepped off the footpath onto the road and he found a safe place to step back on the footpath past the obstacle and we continued on our way.
