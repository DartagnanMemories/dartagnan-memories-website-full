title: But it's the other way, mum

Guide dogs need to learn all the destinations their handler visit. So, in the early days of training with D’artagnan, we learned the route and location of the Feet First podiatry clinic I would need to visit a few times a year. D’artagnan was quick to learn, and we soon were able to make our way to my podiatry appointments on our own. But then the Feet First clinic moved an I was not able to arrange for an instructor to show us the new location. So, I asked for directions and off we went to try and find the new clinic. Normally we always had to turn left to reach the clinic. But now we had to turn right. So, I was standing on the street corner trying to explain to D’artagnan that we were going to Feet First, but that it had moved, and we had to turn right. D’artagnan obstinately tried to turn left, even when I pointed right with my arm and insisted , “right”. This became a stand-off and tussle and we started to attract attention from passers-by. a kind lady approached me and asked if I was okay. “No”, I said, explaining the situation. So, she asked me if she could take me there and I said yes please and took her arm and let her lead me, with D’artagnan still trying to pull me the other way. Finally, we reached the clinic and D’artagnan recognised the friendly receptionist Adelene and wagged his tail, as if to say, “hey mum, why didn’t you tell me Feet First had moved?”.
