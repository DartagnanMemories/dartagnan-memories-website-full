We had gone to the city in a taxi, but the driver had not been able to drop us close to our destination. So D’artagnan and I headed in the general direction where we were meant to go but it’s always daunting for dog or handler to walk in an unfamiliar area. Then we reached a very busy street, and I knew we had to cross it to get to the place where we were going but could not figure out if there was a safe crossing. We were standing there a few minutes wondering what to do when a stranger approached and asked me if I was okay. I explained to him that I needed to cross the busy street. He offered his arm to me and guided us across the street and all the way to our destination.
