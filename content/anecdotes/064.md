D’artagnan had a phenomenal memory. Once I asked him to find the X-Ray clinic on a very busy road in my area. We had not been there for 4 years, and D’artagnan was looking at every shop we past on the way, a little edgy. But suddenly he stopped and turned into a doorway and took me to the counter of the X-Ray place, no hesitation. Another time we got lost and just kept walking until I could find someone to ask for directions. Again, D’artagnan turned into a building and stood by a glass door. I opened it and went to the counter. It was the women’s health centre we had visited also 4 or 5 years ago. He also knew all the neighbours by name and where they lived, once assisting me to take a neighbour home who had got disorientated. And Of course, if he ever did something good when we were out and I told him he would get a treat when we came home, he never let me forget!
