title: Helping a boy to overcome fear of dogs
author: Gisele

When my son was small, he was terrified of dogs. Gisele posted a messageâ€¯looking for people to help him have an off-leash walk, and I thought it would be a great way to help Gisele, help D'artagnan, and help address the fear. So, on Tuesdays after school, Mr 8 and I would pick up a cheese & bacon roll for afternoon tea, then meet Gisele and D'artagnan for an off-leash walk at Peace Park. I think D'artagnan was more interested in Mr 8's cheese & bacon roll than the walk! 

Some time later, Mr 8 (then 13) & Mr Dad were getting off the train at Ashfield and saw Gisele and D'artagnan. Mr Dad had never met D'artagnan, but Mr 13 said "Hello D'artagnan!" and D'artagnan came over to see if there might be a cheese & bacon roll in his future! 

I'll be forever grateful for D'artagnan for helping Mr 8 with his fear of dogs. Mr 8 is now 18 and helps other neighbours walk their dogs.
