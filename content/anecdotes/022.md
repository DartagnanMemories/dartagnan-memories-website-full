D’artagnan and I attended many plays, especially at the Ensemble theatre in Kirribilli. The theatre staff always ensured we had seat with plenty of space for D’artagnan and he enjoyed a nap while the play was on, though at times he did take an interest in what was taking place on stage. On one occasion though , the play must have gone on for a bit too long and he got bored. When it was over and I picked up his leather leash , I was left holding half a leash only: he had chewed right through. I had to go home holding on to the harness handle only, and it made me realise why it’s so important to use both the leash and the handle when walking with a guide dog!
