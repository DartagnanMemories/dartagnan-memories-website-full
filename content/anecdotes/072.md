It was a hot day again and Dâ€™artagnan were standing at a bus stop, unaware that the bus had gone past, and the next bus was not for another hour. A stranger who lived near the bus stop offered us a lift home. I was a little weary of accepting the offer, but another lady neighbour came out and vouched for her neighbour. We were home cooling off in no time. This happened again when we were heading off to a park and the bus had gone past without picking us up. A stranger who lived in the street offered to take us to the park.
