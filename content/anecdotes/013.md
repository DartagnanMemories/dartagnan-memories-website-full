One of D’artagnan’s pet hate was when I took a daytime nap. Although he could happily nap all day on the sofa, if I laid my head on a pillow in the daytime He would always get one of his squeaky toys and poke me with it until I got up and chased him. 

One morning a few days after D’artagnan passed away I was working on a Welcome message for the homepage of his tribute website when I felt an overwhelming tiredness. I went to have a lie down and must have drifted off to sleep. Suddenly D’artagnan Appeared in my bedroom, running around a poking me to get up. His body and it was as though he was truly there in the flesh. 

“But D’artagnan,” I said to him, “you have a tribute website now…if you are here, what am I going to tell everybody.” 

No sooner were the words out of my mouth that I woke up ... sad when I realised it had been a dream but incredibly relieved that I would not have the dilemma of explaining to people that D’artagnan was back in the land of the living. It was also a cathartic dream because I was able to laugh heartily for the first time since he had passed away. I felt as if D’artagnan had reached out from the beyond to play this little joke and remind me that it was daytime, and I should get on with my work.
