title: Perfect

We all know of those instances when a temperamental appliance that has malfunctioned for days, will work perfectly when a technician comes to fix it. And it appears the same applies to guide dogs. I had asked our guide dog instructor Ray to come to correct an issue where D’artagnan was veering across an intersection instead of crossing straight ahead to the other side of the road. The Issue had recurred many times at that same crossing and not at others, and I thought Ray may be able to figure out why this was happening. So Ray comes and off we go with Ray following behind. We arrive at the road crossing and I give the “go straight” command. And this time D’artagnan obediently goes straight to the other side of the road and does not veer one inch across the intersection. Ray who is following behind calls out, “Perfect!” and D’artagnan is standing there with his tail wagging and looking up at mee expectantly. “Reward your dog,” Ray calls out. So, I dig for a treat and give it to D’artagnan with a pat on the head and a “good boy”, while in my head I am saying “You little bugger”.
