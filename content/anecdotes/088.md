title: Don’t use that tone of voice with me

Most dog owners are aware that it is usually best to give dog short sharp commands and that it is the tone of voice that has as much effect as words. We were sitting at a dog park with my legendary guide dog trainer Ray Joyce. We were within earshot of a dog owner who was scolding his dog for something or other the dog had done. We could hear him using long phrases such as, “How many times have I told you….” And “Am I making myself understood?” and so on and so on. Ray laughed and pretended to respond in the voice of the poor berated dog: “I don’t understand a word you are saying. But I don’t like your tone of voice”.
