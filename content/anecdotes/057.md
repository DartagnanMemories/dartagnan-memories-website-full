title: On the train… footrest

We were on a train when I felt a tap on my shoulder. “Excuse me,” said a woman politely , “Your dog is lying on my shoe, and I need to get off at the next stop”. “Oh,” I said, “just pull your foot out,” and ai gently tugged on D’artagnan’s lead to wake him up. “Oh no,” she said, “I don’t want to disturb him. He’s been lying there so peacefully.”. I could feel the train slowing down and heard the announcement over the PA for the next stop. So, I tugged again on D’artagnan’s lead and said, “wake up. Wake up”. Finally, D’artagnan put his head up and the poor woman was able to free her numb foot, and she apologise to D’artagnan as she wobbled out of the train.
