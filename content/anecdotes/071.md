One hot day in the city I was waiting to get a taxi home and D’artagnan was getting restless and stomping his paws on the hot footpath. A taxi pulled up and 2 young Americans got out and said, “here Ma’am , take our cab”. They asked me where I was going, and I told them. When The taxi drove off, the driver told me that the two young men were on their way somewhere and had made him stop when they saw me standing with my dog. And they had also paid my fair home when they had paid him for their fare.
