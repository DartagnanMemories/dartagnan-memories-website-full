On Sunday mornings my friend Tom occasionally accompanied me and D’artagnan to a local park where D’artagnan could run around off-leash. On the way to the park D’artagnan was usually full of energy and enthusiasm, but when we were headed home he was very often in go-slow mode. One Sunday he refused to head towards the exit gate and so we decided to make one more circuit of the park. But D’artagnan pulled toward the parking lot of the park. Then we realised he must have been thinking Tom could just choose one of those cars and drive him home.
