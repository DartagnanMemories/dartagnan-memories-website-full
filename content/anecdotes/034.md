I was minding D’artagnan one day when Gisele was out to Yum Cha with friends. Gisele had left a tin of chicken and vegetables soup for me to give to D’artagnan for his dinner at 5 pm, if she was not home by then. So, when 5 pm came I got the tin of soup and was holding it in one hand and the tin opener in the other. But I was watching a vet show on TV and was curious to find out what the vet would do about a constipated snake. “Wait”, I told D’artagnan .But he didn’t want to wait for his soup, so he whacked me hard with his paw. Just then the doorbell rang, and it was gisele back from her Yum Cha lunch. Gisele was holding a container of left over Yum Cha .D’artagnan was looking at the soup in my hand and the Yum Cha container in Gisele’s hand , not quite sure which one to choose, or perhaps hoping he was going to get both, So I told Gisele about the whack, and she told D’artagnan, “No dinner for you”. But then I felt sorry for him and said, “OH no,”. Gisele gave him the left-over Yum Cha and he was a happy dog.
