title: A bitter pill

Each time I had to give D’artagnan his worming tablet It was a chore to make sure he swallowed it. I tried hiding it in cheese and other food D’artagnan liked but he would always no. Giving him a treat as soon as I had put the tablet in his mouth usually worked best. But he would still spit out the tablet. One day when going through the worming tablet ritual, D’artagnan spat out the treat and swallowed the tablet. When I realised the blunder, I cracked up and gave him back the treat. He sniffed it in my hand suspiciously, probably disbelieving he could possibly have done what he had just done!
