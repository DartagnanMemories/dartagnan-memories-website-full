When I first took D’artagnan for a walk when I was minding him for Gisele, I said to D’artagnan “let’s go this way”. But he spread his legs and dug-in his paws and refused to move forward. Then I asked him, “Okay, so which way do you want to go?”. D’artagnan led the way and we walked on and then returned home. After that, each time I minded him I always asked D’artagnan “Which way?”
