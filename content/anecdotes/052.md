title: Dog ramp

As he got older D’artagnan found it more difficult to hop into cars and so the men from our local Resident Workshop built him a dog ramp. It was a nice dog ramp . But when we put it into position for D’artagnan to get into a friend’s car, he just stood there looking at it. So, with encouraging “ come up” and tapping on the ramp handful of treats, we tried to coax him to climb up. But no go. We tried a few other times and other cars, but he would not step onto the ramp. But he did seem to get in the car mor easily after that, or at least pretend that he could still do it. The ramp is still folded in my garage, if anyone needs a never-used dog ramp!
