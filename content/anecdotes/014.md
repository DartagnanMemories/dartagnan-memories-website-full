I was having lunch at a café in Milsons Point with D'artagnan, Gisele and her friends, Maria, Sharon and Ros with her guide dog, Loree, who has since sadly passed on. Ros had ordered a bowl of hot chips. It was a cold day and the hot chips smelt so tempting that we were all pleased when Ros offered to share them with us. Loree and D’artagnan were quietly lying beside the table. Who knows what D'artagnan was thinking but most probably "Eh? What about me?!" All of a sudden, he jumped up and leaped over to the other side of the table where Ros was sitting holding out one of her piping hot chips to the side so as to let it cool off. Without a doubt D'artagnan noticed that we were all having a lovely time, busy chatting away, and realised that Ros would not see him coming, so he decided to seize the moment and steal the hot chip out of her fingers. It was such a skilful manoeuvre that I was most impressed, but I burst into laughter at the sight of D'artagnan then tossing the piping hot chip around in his mouth, a chip that was just way too hot to swallow but there was no way he was going to give up his ill-gotten booty. After finally managing to eat the hot chip , D’artagnan dove for his bowl of water, and all we could hear was slurp-slurp -slurp above the laughter around the table.
