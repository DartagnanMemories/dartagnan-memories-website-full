Marie Louise , now departed, was a resident in the retirement village where we lived. I enjoyed visiting her and speaking French and talking about her interesting past. D’artagnan also loved to go see Marie-Louise, who always had an apple for him. One day when we came, Marie-Louise was not in her room, and we learned that she had had a turn and was in hospital. D’artagnan refused to go home until one of the attendants raided the locker of another staff member to give him his awaited apple.  
This brings up another memory of visits to Marie-Louise. Each time we arrived at the serviced apartments where Marie-Louise lived, D’artagnan always rushed in and up the ramp and to Marie-Louise’s door and would barge in whenever the door was opened. But on one occasion D’artagnan veered off and led me down the steps of the dining room and towards the TV lounge area, and I heard Marie-Louise calling out “Bonjour!”. How D’artagnan knew Marie-Louise was there still a mystery to me because the dining room and TV area was behind a wall, and he could not have possibly seen her sitting there from the hallway where we came in before heading for the ramp. I can only guess each of us emits an odour that a dog can smell even behind a wall, but still amazing.
