title: On the train… stealing from a baby

We were on a train heading home from the city and waiting near the exit door as our stop was coming up. Suddenly I felt D’artagnan turn and pull behind me and heard a small child cry. It took a few seconds to understand that D’artagnan had stolen a donut from the child, who apparently had been holding it in his hand to the side, as tots often do. I apologised to the parents, who thankfully were very amused and laughed with all the other passengers.
