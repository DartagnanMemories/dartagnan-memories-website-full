We were doing our block walk when D’artagnan suddenly stopped and would not move forward. In such situations guide dog handlers are taught to say to their dog, “find the way” or “ When you can” or such commands that encourage the dog to move forward when it is safe. I gave D’artagnan these repeated instructions, but he didn’t move. Just then a car pulled-up and a woman got out an told me there was a barrier blocking my way and the only way around was to walk on the busy road on the lane where buses and cars were speeding along. So, she left her car on the road and walked us safely to the other side of the barrier. She was so impressed that D’artagnan had refused to let me walk ahead. I was thankful that this good Samaritan had just left her car in traffic to assist us and make sure we were okay.
