Giving D’artagnan medication was at times a bit of a trial. No matter what Gisele did to camouflage the tablet, D’artagnan would smell the medication and clench his teeth and turn his head sideways. And even when Gisele Managed to get it into his mouth, he would spit out the tablet. So, I often assisted gisele, with a lifetime of working as a nurse and lots of experience giving medications to children. But it was a bit of a circus each time we had to get medication down his hatch. One day Gisele forced a tablet down his throat and then gave him a treat as soon as she thought he had swallowed it. And then came the sound of D’artagnan spitting out the…treat. Poor D'artagnan, he quickly realised his error, but it was too late.  
And now each time I have to swallow an unpalatable tablet , I think of D’artagnan as I smother the tablet in something tasty before swallowing it.
