We were down in Melbourne and staying at a hotel. When I checked-in in the evening, the manager asked me what D’artagnan normally had for breakfast. “Oh, at home he has yogurt and apple,” I said ,and aske if it would be okay to bring some yoghurt and an apple back to my room for D’artagnan when I had breakfast. Well just as I was about to go down to breakfast the next morning, there was a knock at the door. It was the hotel manager. He told me he had a bowl of natural yogurt and a bowl of fresh fruits - rockmelon, watermelon, strawberries and so on - for D’artagnan and asked if he could give it to him. I said okay and he put the bowls down in the bathroom an D’artagnan sat there waiting for me to say “okay”, and then he quickly dug-in to his breakfast. “Thank you,” I said to the manager. “You’re welcome.” He said and then added “And you will be okay to go down to the breakfast room?”. “yes” I replied, though truthfully I was a bit apprehensive at finding my way down to the breakfast room and I wondered why I didn’t get free room service!
