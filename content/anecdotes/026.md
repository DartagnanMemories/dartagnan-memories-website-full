title: On the job… street flooded

We started off on our block walk AS USUAL down our street but a few steps along the way D’artagnan stopped and would not move forward. So, I gave him an encouraging “find the way” and “when you can”, but he would NOT MOVE. I decided to return home and just get on with my work and take him for a walk later. Just then an email came in from a neighbour across the street, warning me that the bottom of our street was flooded, and I should not try to go around the block. Once again D’artagnan had kept me safe.
