title: On the job… no train

We were at the train station when I thought I heard the train pulling up on our platform. I asked D’artagnan to “find the door” but he would not move. When I insisted , he put his body across my path so I would also not move forward. A guard approached us and asked me if I needed assistance. I told him I wanted to board the train but my guide dog was not moving. The guard explained there was no train on that platform…the train I had heard had pulled up on the opposite platform.
