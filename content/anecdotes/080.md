One of D’Artagnan’s favourite places to visit was Sydney Park. It is completely off leash for dogs, and there are people picnicking everywhere. D’Artagnan often managed to get away and find a party having a picnic to join, he never seemed to think that people might not like his company over a meal. D’Artagnan strolled slowly mostly, except when he caught scent of a something delicious and then he had the speed of The Flash and disappearing skills of Houdini. My dog Millie would be asked to keep Gisele company while I roamed the park calling for him and asking about a black Labrador. Luckily, he was never far away, and always wherever the food was.
The worst of the Sydney Park experiences was a dual effort from Millie and D’Artagnan. Millie managed to find something that was so enticing, she and D’Artagnan couldn’t drag themselves away. Sydney Park over summer has some extra sleepover residents. They found what could be called the residents scat, and they took great joy rolling in it. They both had to be dragged out of the bushes by their smelly collars away from the seemingly mesmerising mess.
Needless to say, all the windows were open on that trip home and they both rode up the back.
