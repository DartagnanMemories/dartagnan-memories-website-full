We boarded an express to the city train at Ashfield and sat in the side seats as always. A woman stepped on and loudly asked if it was an all-station train. Several passengers told her it was an express. “Will it stop at Petersham?,” she loudly insisted. “ NO,” answered several voices. “Ah, yous don’t know what yous are talking about,” she muttered and sat down. The train zipped past several stations and when it zipped past Petersham, the woman got up and swore loudly, asking “Why didn’t you **lot tell me it was not** stopping at Petersham?”. A few passengers riposted and the woman got louder and foul-mouth. Hoping to lighten the mood, I said, “Even my guide dog knew it was an express!”. The woman completely changed mood and said, “Really? Oh wow! They are such smart dogs. ”. She sat down and was quiet for the rest of the trip and got off at Redfern and even apologised for her behaviour. The man sitting next to me then asked, “Was that true?”. “no,” I replied somewhat feeling ashamed. I explained that D’artagnan always seemed to know when our stop was coming up but that I didn’t think he would know if the train was an express or an all-station. Passengers were still impressed by this ability, which he demonstrated when he got up as the train was approaching our stop at Town Hall.
