D’artagnan had doggie shoes for those hot days when the pavement was too hot for him to walk bare paws, But it was a trial fitting the little shoes to his four paws, and he was not happy to wear them. Then we would set off, but he would always kick at least one shoe off before we got out of the driveway , and I would have to put it back on his paw. Then I would have to keep feeling his paws to check that he had not kicked-off another shoe as we walked along….so I always tried to avoid going out on hot days.
