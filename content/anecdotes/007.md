title: Three for Lunch

I had a friend visiting and I prepared two smoked salmon with tomato, cucumber and lettuce bread rolls for our lunch. I thought, “a little bit of fresh coriander would go well with the rolls.” So, I popped outside to get some from the planter box in the garden. When I came back into the kitchen, I could only feel 1 bread roll on the counter. “Did you get hungry,” I called out to my friend who was sitting at the dining table. She made a perplexed response, so I explained that one of the bread rolls was missing. She came over to check and there was definitely only 1 roll on the bench top and nothing on the floor. We both looked at D’artagnan, lying in his usual spot by the kitchen entrance. Hmmm. I guess he must have thought “why did mum only prepare 2 bread rolls when there are three of us here for lunch?” So, he helped himself to his and left the second roll for my friend and I to share.
