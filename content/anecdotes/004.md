title: Stranger Danger

One morning when D’artagnan was just 4 years old we were walking around the block at around 5am, the time I usually took him for his first toileting, and suddenly he stopped and I could feel his body stiffen, like dogs do when they might see another dog or some danger.  He wouldn't move forward so I tried to turn around to go home, but he just kept staring ahead.  Then I heard a man's voice call out, "It's okay, I'm just sitting on the wall here". That appeared to relax D'artagnan, and he moved forward. The stranger was just an electrician, waiting for his mate to do a job. So, all was okay, but I was impressed and comforted that, D'artagnan had spotted the man sitting there and quite rightly determined that, at that time of the morning, that wasn't quite right. Pretty amazing.
