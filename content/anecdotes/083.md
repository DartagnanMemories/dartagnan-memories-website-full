Dâ€™artagnan knew all our neighbours by name and knew who lived where. In his time, we attended three funerals together, and he was always on his best behaviour during these services. But he also seemed to understand when people and other dogs had passed on , or simply moved on : And when Marie-Louise, Line, Sheila and Linda passed on, he appeared to understand that our days of visiting and getting apples, pears and mandarins or other treats were over. It was the same with his doggie friends who passed on or moved on: Ellie, Millie and Alice have now gone to the Rainbow Bridge and joined others of his doggie friends and perhaps he will be reunited with them in that happy place.
