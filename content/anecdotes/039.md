I have a wheelchair and I’m blind.
Whenever I would meet Gisele D’artagnan would always recognise me and my carer.
He would follow behind me guiding Gisele.
One time we were waiting at Circular Quay.
Instead of heading for me he decided he was hungry and headed straight for the restaurant.
Then we went on the ferry, and I had my hand resting on Gisele’s shoulder talking very close but D’artagnan saw us and must have thought, what are you doing, Touching my mother and jumped up and pushed in between us, not letting me touch Gisele.
He was devoted and loved and protected Gisele.
So, we miss him very much and hope Gisele will have just as good a companion in the future.
