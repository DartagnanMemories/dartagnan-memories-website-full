title: Fit for a King

The real Count D’artagnan served King Louis ZIV for a time, but D’artagnan the guide dog believed he was a king. In 2015 we travelled to Melbourne at the invitation of Coles to consult on the accessibility of their website. They put us up in a hotel in a room with a king bed. I went to freshen up in the bathroom and when I came back into our room I found D’artagnan stretched out the full length of the king bed, sleeping soundly. Well, it had been a long trip on the train, and I guess my poor D’artagnan was tired. I had to sleep with my knees tucked under me so I would not disturb His Highness.
