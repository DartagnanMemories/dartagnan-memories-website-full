Gisele was coming around the corner of the walkway that leads to my place when I noticed that D’artagnan had a swollen face. “What’s the matter with his face?”, Asked. D’artagnan looked down and I bent to check his muzzle. It was indeed very swollen. I forced him to open his jaws and found a semi-eaten avocado with its stone still attached. I warned him of the danger of dogs swallowing an avocado stone, not to mention that avocado flesh is also not recommended for dogs. But poor D’artagnan was pretty miffed that I had dobbed him in just before he had made it home to enjoy his find.
