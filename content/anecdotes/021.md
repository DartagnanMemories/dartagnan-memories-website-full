D’artagnan and I attended many accessibility events, including the A11y Camps. There are many stories to share about our times at these interesting and fun events. When the events went online in 2020 due to Covid 19,D’artagnan was pretty miffed, especially because it meant he would miss out on pizza and doggie donuts and ”being there”. On one occasion when we were there , there was a sketch artist who sat close-by as he sketched in real-time the speeches at the event. That was when D’artagnan had a coughing fit. I could imagine the sketch artist looking at D’artagnan and then at the speaker and then at the organisers at the official table, wondering if he should include D’artagnan’s coughing fit in his visual recording of the event!
