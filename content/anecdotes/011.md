One Christmas my brother Philippe gave D’artagnan a rubber pig that oinked when squeezed. 

D’artagnan loved squeaky toys but he seemed frightened of this little pig . When young Damien visited one day and happily played with the oinking pig, D’artagnan gave it to Damien to take home. “Ah”, he said, “piggy is gone!” I told a friend that D’artagnan had given his toy pig away to a young boy. So this friend decided to buy another pig just like it and gave it to D’artagnan. “Oh horrors!,” D’artagnan thought, “It’s back!, but he was too polite and too macho to tell my friend the truth!
