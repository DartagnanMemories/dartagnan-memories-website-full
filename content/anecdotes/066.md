We were at a dog park when my friend told me that Dâ€™artagnan and another dog appeared to be having a peeing competition. Each of the two dogs would take turn to pipi on the same spot. My friend started counting and got up to 14 pipi for each dog and declared it a draw. We did puzzle as to how either dog could have kept it up for that many pipis!
