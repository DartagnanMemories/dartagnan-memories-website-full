I was waiting in line with D’artagnan at a grocery store when a man tapped me on my arm and put something in my hand. Then he left the store without a word I could feel it was a bank note. Perplexed, I asked the cashier , “What is it?”. “It’s a $50 note” she replied, “When that man put it in your hand, he pointed to your dog.”
