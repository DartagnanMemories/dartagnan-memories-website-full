title: Cooks River dip

One of D’Artagnan’s favourite pastimes was swimming. With the Cooks river being so close, Gisele and I thought we would walk along the river and possibly find a spot for him to have a dip.
It was a warm day, and we weren’t having much luck with an accessible bank for D’Artagnan to enter the river for a swim, when he took it upon himself to dive off the bank into the mangroves and lurch out towards the water. After having a lovely dip, he decided it was enough and he wanted to get out, but there was a metre high wall, and the sludge of the mangroves to traverse. The more he searched for a way out, the worst the situation got, travelling 200 metres up the river with Gisele and I yelling from the bank, and many bemused onlookers.
The only way out was for me to get into the mangroves and pick up all 40 or so kilos of him and push him towards the top of the wall. Luckily this worked, but my shoes came off in the sludge and I had more trouble getting out myself than getting him out. I walked barefoot to find somewhere to wash myself and D’Artagnan off before driving home. Luckily the golf course had a hose, or I would have been hosing out the car too.
Of course, there was never any remorse for D’Artagnan’s escapades, more a “what took you so long” look!
