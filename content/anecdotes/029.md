title: On the job… last duty

When the vet came to pick-up D’artagnan on the day before he passed away, D’artagnan stood up and let me walk him to the waiting van in the street. As we approached the steps outside our place, he put his foot on the first step in proper guide dog mode and waited for me to step up before climbing the rest of the steps. Even on this last day, sick as he was because his heart was failing, he remembered his guide dog duty and took me safely to the curb of the street before the vet took him to the van.
