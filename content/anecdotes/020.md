Gisele and D’artagnan were due to go out to an evening dinner in the city so Gisele ordered a taxi. Timing was crucial because they had to pick-up someone on the way in peak-hour traffic and be at the function on time by 6pm. But as the taxi arrived at the parking bay of Gisele’s place, she realised D’artagnan had done one of his disappearing acts. I and the other neighbours were all calling him, but he was nowhere to be found. D’artagnan had already been fed but Gisele called out “Dinner!”. Then we all heard galloping paws and D’artagnan’s little collar bell jingling, and he turned into the pathway and was soon at Gisele’s side. “Get in” she said, as she pulled him into the waiting taxi. “naughty boy,” I said to him in my most stern voice. He was not used to this from me because I always call him “Gorgeous boy” . D’artagnan looked at me pleadingly as if to say, “But Aunty Carmel, this is not fair: Mum called out dinner!”.
