One day I was sitting on a bench sharing a mandarin with D’artagnan, when a homeless man approached us and commented on my dog eating mandarins. “Yes,” I said, “He loves them”. “He wants more,” the man said. “He always wants more,” I replied The man went away and came back with a brown paper bag and handed it to me…in the bag were 5 mandarins. “Enjoy,” he said, and walked away as I said, “thank you.”
