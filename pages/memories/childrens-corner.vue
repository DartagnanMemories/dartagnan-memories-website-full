      <p>D’artagnan loved children, and children loved him.  This corner of the website is for children to share their tributes to D’artagnan: paintings, drawings, poems, stories or imaginings.</p>
      <p>If it’s a painting or drawing, please describe it in words so that people who are blind can picture in their mind what you have painted or drawn.</p>
      <p>Please include first name and age. If you wish, you can also include suburb or country.</p>
      <p>Thank you</p>
